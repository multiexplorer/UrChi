      "Spirituality is the broad concept of a belief in something beyond the self. It may involve religious traditions centering on the belief in a higher power, but it can also involve a holistic belief in an individual connection to others and to the world as a whole.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Spirituality offers a worldview that suggests there is more to life than just what people experience on a sensory and physical level.\n",
      "Instead, it suggests that there is something greater that connects all beings to each other and to the universe itself. It also proposes that there is ongoing existence after death and strives to answer questions about the meaning of life, how people are connected to each other, truths about the universe, and other mysteries of human existence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spirituality and religious activity have been a source of comfort and relief from stress for multitudes of people. While people use many different religions and paths to find God or to express their spirituality, research has shown that those who are more religious or spiritual and use their spirituality to cope with challenges in life experience many benefits to their health and well-being.\n",
      "﻿﻿\n",
      "\n",
      "Signs of Spirituality\n",
      "Spirituality is not a single path or belief system. There are many ways to experience spirituality and the benefits of a spiritual experience. For some people, this might involve the belief in a higher power or a specific religious practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For others, it may involve experiencing a sense of connection to a higher state or a sense of inter-connectedness with the rest of humanity and nature. Some signs of spirituality can include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tAsking deep questions about topics such as suffering and what happens after death\n",
      "\t\tDeepening connections with other people\n",
      "\t\tExperiencing compassion and empathy for others\n",
      "\t\tExperiencing feelings of interconnectedness\n",
      "\t\tFeelings of awe and wonder\n",
      "\t\tSeeking happiness beyond material possessions or other external rewards\n",
      "\t\tSeeking meaning and purpose\n",
      "\t\tWanting to make the world a better place\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not everyone experiences or expresses spirituality in the same way. Some people may seek spiritual experiences in every aspect of their lives, while others may be more likely to have these feelings under specific conditions or in certain locations. For example, some people may be more likely to have spiritual experiences in churches or other religious temples, while some might have these feelings when they out enjoying nature.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Types of Spirituality\n",
      "There are many different types of spirituality, ranging from religious traditions to more secular approaches. Some of the major forms of spirituality include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tBuddhism\n",
      "\t\tChristianity\n",
      "\t\tHinduism\n",
      "\t\tHumanism\n",
      "\t\tIslam\n",
      "\t\tJudaism\n",
      "\t\tNew age spirituality\n",
      "\t\tSikhism\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to remember that there are many other spiritual traditions that exist throughout the world, including traditional African and Indigenous spiritual practices. Such spiritual practices can be particularly important to groups of people who have been subjected to the effects of colonialism.\n",
      "Uses\n",
      "There are a number of different reasons why people may turn to spirituality, including but not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tTo find purpose and meaning: Exploring spirituality can help people find answers to questions they have about philosophical questions such as \"what is the meaning of life?\" and \"what purpose does my life serve?\"\n",
      "\t\tTo cope with feelings of stress, depression, and anxiety: Spiritual experiences can be helpful when coping with the stresses of life. \n",
      "\t\tTo restore hope and optimism: Spirituality can help people develop a more hopeful outlook on life.\n",
      "\t\tTo find a sense of community and support: Because spiritual traditions often involve organized religions or groups, becoming a part of such a group can serve as an important source of social support.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impact of Spirituality\n",
      "While specific spiritual views are a matter of faith, research has demonstrated some of the benefits of spirituality and spiritual activity. The results may surprise no one who has found comfort in their religious or spiritual views, but they are definitely noteworthy in that they demonstrate in a scientific way that these activities do have benefits for many people.\n",
      "\n",
      "The following are a few more of the many positive findings related to spirituality and its influence on physical and mental health:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tResearch has shown that religion and spirituality can help people cope with the effects of everyday stress. One study found that everyday spiritual experiences helped older adults better cope with negative feelings and enhanced positive feelings.\n",
      "\t\tResearch shows that older women are more grateful to God than older men, and they receive greater stress-buffering health effects due to this gratitude.3﻿\n",
      "\t\tAccording to research, those with an intrinsic religious orientation, regardless of gender, exhibited less physiological reactivity toward stress than those with an extrinsic religious orientation.4﻿ Those who were intrinsically oriented dedicated their lives to God or a \"higher power,\" while the extrinsically oriented ones used religion for external ends like making friends or increasing community social standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "This, along with other research, demonstrates that there may be tangible and lasting benefits to maintaining involvement with a spiritual community. This involvement, along with the gratitude that can accompany spirituality, can be a buffer against stress and is linked to greater levels of physical health.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dedication to God or a \"higher power\" translated into less stress reactivity, greater feelings of well-being, and ultimately even a decreased fear of death.\n",
      "People who feel comfortable and comforted using spirituality as a coping mechanism for stress can rest assured that there's even more evidence that this is a good idea for them. Prayer works for young and old alike. Prayer and spirituality have been linked to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tBetter health\n",
      "\t\tGreater psychological well-being\n",
      "\t\tLess depression5﻿\n",
      "\t\tLess hypertension\n",
      "\t\tLess stress, even during difficult times6﻿\n",
      "\t\tMore positive feelings\n",
      "\t\tSuperior ability to handle stress\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips\n",
      "Whether you are rediscovering a forgotten spiritual path, reinforcing your commitment to an already well-established one, or seeking a new source of spiritual fulfillment, exploring your spiritual side may help improve your well-being.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spirituality is a very personal experience, and everyone’s spiritual path may be unique. Research shows, however, that some spiritual stress relief strategies have been helpful to many, regardless of faith.7﻿﻿ Some things you can do to start exploring spirituality include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tPay attention to how you are feeling: Part of embracing spirituality means also embracing what it means to be human, both the good and the bad. \n",
      "\t\tFocus on others: Opening your heart, feeling empathy, and helping others are important aspects of spirituality.\n",
      "\t\tMeditate: Try spending 10 to 15 minutes each morning engaged in some form of meditation.\n",
      "\t\tPractice gratitude: Start a gratitude journal and record what you are grateful for each day. This can be a great reminder of what is most important to you and what brings you the greatest happiness.\n",
      "\t\tTry mindfulness: By becoming more mindful, you can become more aware and appreciative of the present. Mindfulness encourages you to be less judgmental (both of yourself and others) and focus more on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or future.\n",
      "Visualization meditation is a powerful way to use the mind to influence the body and can also be an empowering way to manifest desired outcomes in your life. Deepak Chopra teaches that what we place our attention on grows stronger and what we take our attention away from will begin to diminish. The unconscious mind is extremely powerful and it works very well with imagery.\n",
      "One common visualization practice is centered around health. By visualizing your body-mind as being healthy, vibrant, and energized—or grounded, peaceful, and calm—you can begin to elicit these things both mentally and physically. Another approach is using visual imagery for creative purposes. By constructing an image in your mind of what your life might look like after having accomplished a goal and really seeing yourself having already achieved it is a way to begin living in ways that support the manifestation of your desired outcome.\n",
      "To meditate using visual imagery, practice the following:\n",
      "\t1\tIdentify your desired outcome. For example, do you wish to feel more grounded and at peace in your mind and emotions? Or would you like to envision your physical body as being healthy, vibrant, and strong? Or are you longing to create art, write poetry, be in a new relationship, or travel abroad?\n",
      "\t2\tCreate an internal representation of what this looks, sounds, and feels like. Make it as real and as compelling as possible.\n",
      "\t3\tEnter into a meditative state by relaxing and taking some deep breaths and then bring the image into your awareness. Associate yourself into the picture by stepping inside it and feeling as if it has already happened.\n",
      "\t4\tWhen it's time to come out of meditation, simply allow the image to fade off into the distance and relinquish any attachment to the outcome.\n",
      "\t5\tMeditate in this fashion anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes each day.\n",
      "Japa or Mantra-Based Meditation\n",
      "Japa meditation is a mantra-based meditation path that is one of the oldest, most revered classical techniques known today. The word “mantra” translates to mind vehicle or mind instrument. Japa meditation has the practitioner repeating a word or phrase for the duration of the meditation, with the mantra being the focal point throughout.\n",
      "During the practice, whenever you drift away from the mantra to other thoughts, sounds, or physical sensations, you simply guide your focus back to the repetition of the mantra. Think of it as a dance back and forth between mantra and thought. Some mantras have a specific meaning and it’s said that by repeating the mantra, you are connecting to the energetic essence of its intention.\n",
      "Other mantras purposely have no meaning and are designed to help access deeper levels of silence. In this approach, eventually, the mantra and thoughts will cancel one another out. When this happens, your conscious awareness transcends the busyness of the mind and reaches higher states of consciousness.\n",
      "Popular styles of mantra-based meditation are Primordial Sound Meditation as taught by Deepak Chopra and the age-old practice of the So Hum meditation. Both of these practices are easily learned in person or online for your convenience.\n",
      "Loving-Kindness or Metta Meditation\n",
      "Metta meditation, also known as Loving-Kindness meditation, is designed to cultivate four qualities of love: friendliness (Metta), compassion (Karuna), appreciative joy (Mudita), and equanimity (Upekkha). The quality of Metta, or friendliness, is expressed as genuine compassion sent out with the intention of surrounding ourselves and others with loving-kindness. With all that is going on in the world today, Metta meditation is a worthwhile practice for each of us to spend some time in each day. This style of meditation also works well as an entrance point for the practice of forgiveness and can be a powerful tool for lessening the charge of negative emotions we have toward those who have wronged us.\n",
      "While there are various approaches to Metta meditation, this audio clip on Loving Kindness Meditation is a thorough and well-spoken version.\n",
      "Another variation will have you think silently to yourself, “May I be filled with loving-kindness. May I be well. May I be peaceful and at ease. May I be truly happy.” You would then bring someone else into your mind (someone you love and/or someone who you are feeling challenged by) and say silently, \"May you be filled with loving-kindness. May you be well. May you be peaceful and at ease. May you be truly happy.” You may then bring all of humanity into your awareness and send the same intention out to the collective—to all sentient beings, “May we be filled with loving-kindness. May we be well. May we be peaceful and at ease. May we be truly happy.”\n",
      "Once you have done this meditation a few times and you remember the process, you can begin to do the meditation on your own without listening to the audio file. Choose whatever language you prefer to use and practice this meditation for a period of time to see how it resonates with you.\n",
      "Breath-Awareness Meditation\n",
      "Breath-awareness meditation is a simple practice of finding a comfortable seat, closing your eyes, and placing your attention in the inhalation and exhalation of your breath. Breath awareness is an effective way to establish a greater mind-body connection and to reduce stress. This form of meditation can be your preferred meditation practice each day and it is also a highly useful way to calm you down during any moment of tension in the workplace and at home.\n",
      "Once you’ve tried a few different types of meditation, you will have a better idea of what resonates with you and what doesn't. The most important thing to remember is that there is no right or wrong meditation; there are many paths that all lead to the same destination, and the beauty of life is that we get to choose our own path.\n",
      "Keep it simple at the beginning and just feel out some different techniques. When you find a routine that you enjoy, the next step is to set aside 15 to 20 minutes each day to cultivate your meditative practice. From there, tend to your practice each day and you will experience a number of life-changing benefits to your health and well-being.\n",
      "On a surface level, the mental body is your thoughts. On a deeper level, it is the domain of your beliefs, desires, values, and goals. Beliefs are opinions and convictions that we hold as being true without having immediate proof. Values represent what we hold internally as most important in an area of life. Values and beliefs can come from thoughts that were formed very early in childhood.\n",
      "We all have desires to achieve or acquire something in our lives, which is why we set goals and intentions to help us get where we want to go. Some surface-level thoughts, which may create goals or desires, direct our mental focus from moment to moment. This is how our logical, linear minds learn and operate, and it is one of the aspects of ourselves that is most familiar to us.\n",
      "As energy flows down from the mental body into the emotional body, it can bump into stored baggage from the past and create some turbulence. Stored baggage can come from past fears, which can project into the future and cause anxiety. Or, it can come from experiencing a lot of anger or resentment toward someone, which can cause anger or resentment later in life when familiar conditions repeat. You may even develop negative beliefs about people.\n",
      "Practices for the Mental Body:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t•\tSet goals\n",
      "\t•\tGet a coach or mentor to keep you focused on your goals\n",
      "\t•\tDaily Recapitulation\n",
      "\t•\tContinue your education (e.g., read books or take classes)\n",
      "\t•\tEliminate stressors from your life\n",
      "We found four relevant publications, including two reviews on the effects of yoga on depression , a description of studies on yogic breathing  for depression, and one “summary” . The reviewing authors have reported that the studies reviewed showed a large variety of diagnoses ranging from “major depression or some other type of diagnosed depression” to “elevated depressive symptoms” . Although several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported beneficial effects of yoga interventions for treating depressive symptoms, the quality and quantity of the data from these studies appear insufficient to conclude whether there is substantial clinical justification to consider yoga as a treatment of depression. Compared to passive controls, the yoga interventions seem to be effective; when compared with active controls, not surprisingly, the effects are less conclusive . The study results are so far not sufficient in quantity and quality to determine whether studies with a focus on the asanas are more effective as compared to studies with meditation-focussed or pranayama-focussed styles. Thus, there is a strong need to conduct more conclusive studies with high methodological quality and larger patient samples. Whether motivation of depressed patients could be a problem or not remains to be clarified. There has been an attempt to explore mechanisms of action and to understand the complete picture of the effects of yoga in depression looking at electrophysiological markers of attention, and neurotransmitters which were found to change with yoga [7, 31].\n",
      "The six branches are:\n",
      "\t•\tHatha yoga: This is the physical and mental branch designed to prime the body and mind.\n",
      "\t•\tRaja yoga: This branch involves meditation and strict adherence to a series of disciplinary steps known as the “eight limbs” of yoga.\n",
      "\t•\tKarma yoga: This is a path of service that aims to create a future free from negativity and selfishness.\n",
      "\t•\tBhakti yoga: This aims to establish the path of devotion, a positive way to channel emotions and cultivate acceptance and tolerance.\n",
      "\t•\tJnana yoga: This branch of yoga is about wisdom, the path of the scholar, and developing the intellect through study.\n",
      "\t•\tTantra yoga: This is the pathway of ritual, ceremony, or consummation of a relationship.\n",
      "Yoga maintains that chakras are center points of energy, thoughts, feelings, and the physical body. According to yogic teachers, chakras determine the way people experience reality through emotional reactions, desires or aversions, levels of confidence or fear, and even physical symptoms and effects.\n",
      "When energy becomes blocked in a chakra, it is said to trigger physical, mental, or emotional imbalances that manifest in symptoms, such as anxiety, lethargy, or poor digestion.\n",
      "Asanas are the many physical positions in Hatha yoga. People who practice yoga use asanas to free energy and stimulate an imbalanced chakra.\n",
      "Ashtanga yoga: This type of yoga uses ancient yoga teachings. However, it became popular during the 1970s. Ashtanga applies six established sequences of postures that rapidly link every movement to breath.\n",
      "Bikram yoga: Also known as “hot” yoga, Bikram occurs in artificially heated rooms at temperatures of nearly 105 degrees and 40 percent humidity. It consists of 26 poses and a sequence of two breathing exercises.\n",
      "Hatha yoga: This is a generic term for any type of yoga that teaches physical postures. “Hatha” classes usually serve as a gentle introduction to the basic yoga postures.\n",
      "Iyengar yoga: This type focuses on finding the correct alignment in each pose using a range of props, such as blocks, blankets, straps, chairs, and bolsters.\n",
      "Jivamukti yoga: Jivamukti means “liberation while living.” This type emerged in 1984 and incorporates spiritual teachings and practices that focus on the fast-paced flow between poses rather than the poses themselves.\n",
      "This focus is called vinyasa. Each class has a theme, which is explored through yoga scripture, chanting, meditation, asana, pranayama, and music. Jivamukti yoga can be physically intense.\n",
      "Kripalu yoga: This type teaches practitioners to know, accept, and learn from the body. A student of Kripalu learns to find their own level of practice by looking inward. The classes usually begin with breathing exercises and gentle stretches, followed by a series of individual poses and final relaxation.\n",
      "Kundalini yoga: Kundalini means “coiled, like a snake.” Kundalini yoga is a system of meditation that aims to release pent-up energy.\n",
      "A class typically begins with chanting and ends with singing. In between, it features asana, pranayama, and meditation customized to create a specific outcome.\n",
      "Power yoga: In the late 1980s, practitioners developed this active and athletic type of yoga, based on the traditional ashtanga system.\n",
      "Sivananda: This is a system based on a five-point philosophy. This philosophy maintains that proper breathing, relaxation, diet, exercise, and positive thinking work together to form a healthy yogic lifestyle. Typically uses the same 12 basic asanas, bookended by sun salutations and savasana poses.\n",
      "Viniyoga: Viniyoga can adapt to any person, regardless of physical ability. Viniyoga teachers require in-depth training and tend to be experts on anatomy and yoga therapy.\n",
      "Yin: This is a quiet, meditative yoga practice, also called taoist yoga. Yin yoga allows the release of tension in key joints, including:\n",
      "\t•\tthe ankles\n",
      "\t•\tknees\n",
      "\t•\t· hips\n",
      "\t•\tthe whole back\n",
      "\t•\tneck\n",
      "\t•\tshoulders\n",
      "Yin poses are passive, meaning that gravity shoulders most of the force and effort.\n",
      "Prenatal yoga: Prenatal yoga uses postures that practitioners have designed for people who are pregnant. It can support people in getting back into shape after pregnancy as well as supporting health iduring pregnancy.\n",
      "Restorative yoga: This is a relaxing method of yoga. A person spends a restorative yoga class in four or five simple poses, using props like blankets and bolsters to sink into deep relaxation without exerting any effort in holding the pose.\n",
      "Studies suggest a positive association of spirituality and health behaviors with well-being (especially subjective well-being), but still the precise character of such relationships between all these constructs remains unknown. The present study aims to explore the relations between spirituality, health-related behaviors, and psychological well-being in the context of acquired education. A questionnaire survey was conducted among 595 students from six different universities, whose study programs either focused on the human body or the human mind and spirit. Path analysis and linear regression were used to model the relationship between the examined constructs. The results show that both spirituality and health-related behaviors are positively related to psychological well-being, and that the relationship with spirituality is also mediated by health-related behaviors. Only spirituality is associated with the type of acquired education, especially in the group of students whose studies focus on the human mind and spirit. Moreover, spirituality in this group seems to display a stronger relationship with psychological well-being. These findings may contribute to the better understanding of some significant determinants of psychological well-being. They carry important implications for the faculty members responsible for curriculum preparation to account for teaching contents related to the conduct of a healthy lifestyle and to spiritual development.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Almost 20 years ago, following the commencement of the positive psychology movement, the research approach in the areas of psychology, especially those concerning mental health, began to change, concentrating on a much greater interest in well-being than on mere diseases or disorders (Bhullar et al., 2014). Two main directions have emerged in well-being research: one based on a hedonistic approach and the other on eudaimonia. According to the hedonistic approach, well-being is concerned with affective pleasure in someone’s life (Watson et al., 1988). The term subjective well-being (SWB) is used in positive psychology in the sense of a high level of positive affect, a low level of negative affect, and a high degree of satisfaction with one’s life (Deci and Ryan, 2008). In contrast, in the eudaemonist approach, well-being is perceived as the degree to which people function so that they could realize their full potential (Waterman, 1993). In publications on positive psychology eudaimonism is often synonymous with psychological well-being (PWB; Ryan and Deci, 2001).\n",
      "\n",
      "Recently, the main direction in studies of determinants of well-being has focused on subjective well-being (Diener, 2000). Demographic determinants (Argyle, 1999), cognitive and motivational determinants (Lyubomirsky, 2001), and personality determinants (Park, et al., 2004) of subjective well-being have been identified. Less attention is currently paid to psychological well-being, however, some research indicated religion and spirituality to be significant PWB implications (Levin and Chatters, 1998; Lawler-Row and Elliott, 2009) and revealed associations between pro-health behaviors, spirituality, and well-being (Boswell et al., 2006). At present, in a holistic view of health beyond biological and psychosocial well-being, the spiritual dimension of well-being is frequently discussed. This new construct is defined as a sense of connection with others, sense of life, and relationship with a transcendent force. It has psychosocial and religious components, and it is believed to promote spiritual health (Ghaderi et al., 2018; Alborzi et al., 2019). The present study attempts to gain a better insight into relationships between spirituality, health-related behavior, and psychological well-being with regard to the type of acquired education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Theoretical Background\n",
      "Psychological Well-Being\n",
      "The answer to the question “What does it mean to feel well psychologically?” needs to be sought in literature on humanistic psychology, including developmental and health psychology (Ryff, 1989). Ryff created a multidimensional construct of well-being, building on such concepts as basic life tendencies of Buhler (1935), psychosocial stages of Erikson (1959), personality changes of Neugarten (1973), positive criteria of mental health of Jahoda (1958), account of individuation of Jung (1933), formulation of maturity of Allport (1961), depiction of the fully-functioning person of Rogers (1961), and notion of self-actualization of Maslow (1968).\n",
      "Psychological well-being covers a wide range of welfare including positive assessments of oneself and one’s past life (Self-Acceptance), a sense of continued growth and development as a person (Personal Growth), the belief that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful (Purpose in Life), the possession of quality relations with others (Positive Relations With Others), the capacity to manage effectively one’s life and the surrounding world (Environmental Mastery), and a sense of self-determination (Autonomy; Ryff and Keyes, 1995, p. 720). Ryff and Singer (1998) also developed a measure to assess the above six distinct factors of positive psychological functioning.\n",
      "Both the model and the measure came under review. The former was criticized for the lack of independence of individual scales (Springer and Hausner, 2006). According to various researchers, Personal Growth, Purpose in Life, Self-Acceptance, and Environmental Mastery do form a single scale. The latter was criticized for its lack of factorial validity or internal consistency (van Dierendonck, 2004). However, some other studies supported the six-factor PWB model (Ryff and Singer, 2006; van Dierendonck et al., 2008) and also revealed the existence of a single higher-order PWB factor above the subscales (Keyes et al., 2002).\n",
      "The concept of PWB corresponds to the WHO definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, formulated in 1948 (WHO, 1948). A high level of PWB is associated with a lower risk of depression (Ryff and Keyes, 1995; Fava, 1999), a lower possibility of displaying risk behavior (Yonker et al., 2012), and a decreased immune cell expression of a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA; Fredrickson et al., 2015).\n",
      "Spirituality\n",
      "According to Joseph et al. (2017, p. 506), spirituality should be understood as “a more general, unstructured, personalized, and naturally occurring phenomenon, where a person seeks closeness and/or connectedness between him/herself and a higher power or purpose.” Other authors define spirituality in terms of search for universal truth and as an activity enabling people to discover meaning and significance in the surrounding world (Woods and Ironson, 1999). Spirituality can also be perceived as a dynamic reality, constantly exploring something new; it may also involve the learning of the ultimate boundaries of existence and seeking a broader meaning of life. Hart (1994, p. 23) defined spirituality as a way in which an individual experiences his or her faith in everyday life and style “in which the individual refers to the final conditions of individual existence.”\n",
      "Spirituality therefore forms a multidimensional theoretical construct. In essence, it constitutes transcendence understood as going beyond or above “the real I.” In this context, spirituality is defined as experiencing transcendence through inner peace, harmony, or connectedness to others (Boswell et al., 2006). Transcendence can take place both within the person (self-realization, self-improvement, and personal development) and outside the person. “External” transcendence may be directed to a higher entity or energy; to another person, claimed to be of particular value, whose good is more important than one’s own good; or to the universe (Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska, 2004). Spirituality differs from religion as the latter is rather linked with specific rituals, institutional dependencies, and social relationships, whereas the former is more about personal experience of what is unseen and recognized as greater than ourselves (Tovar-Murray, 2011). Thoresen (1998) claims that religion is perceived mainly as a social phenomenon, while spirituality is usually considered at the individual level and within a specific context. Despite their common transcendence-related roots, spirituality and religiosity may not be treated interchangeably. These are different areas, however, overlapping in their meaning (Krok, 2009a).\n",
      "Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska (2004) understand transcendence as a common denominator for many concepts of spirituality. The two-way understanding of transcendence, described above as self-improvement and as a turn toward a higher-being, makes it possible to examine the phenomenon of spirituality using the methodology of psychological sciences, without questioning theological and philosophical perspectives (Krok, 2009a).\n",
      "Studies demonstrated the positive impact of spirituality on physical health and mental health as well as on other positive health outcomes such as subjective well-being, health-related quality of life, coping skills, recovering from mental illness, or less addictive or suicidal behaviors (Mueller et al., 2001; Miller and Thoresen, 2003; Kharitonov, 2012; Unterrainer et al., 2014). However, we must bear in mind that spirituality is a complex construct and as such it is defined in multiple ways and measured with different tools (Lun and Bond, 2013).\n",
      "In our study, we used the Self-Reported Questionnaire by Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska (2004), in which the overall factor Spirituality consists of Religious Attitudes (religious experiences, their importance in everyday life, their influence on moral choices and behavior, and relationship to God); Ethical Sensitivity (high place of ethical values in the hierarchy of values, our compliance with them, and tendency toward ethical reflection); and Harmony (seeking harmony with the world, internal consistency, and cohesion of various forms of one’s own activity). These dimensions reflect the main manifestations of spirituality available in internal experience, distinguished on the basis of descriptions of specific manifestations of spirituality in psychological literature (Hill et al., 2000; Socha, 2000; Thoresen and Harris, 2002), subsequently ordered according to the aforementioned directions of transcendence (me, God, other people, and the world).\n",
      "Health-Related Behavior\n",
      "Lifestyle and lifestyle-related health behaviors are some of the determinants of health potential (Binkowska-Bury et al., 2010). A health behavior is any activity undertaken to prevent or detect disease or to improve health and well-being (Conner and Norman, 1996). In studies on health behavior and behavioral change, health behaviors are usually divided into those associated with physical activity, diet, and the use of psychoactive substances (Norman et al., 2008). However, there are currently other more popular approaches that consider multiple lifestyle-forming health behaviors, between which different interactions take place (op. cit).\n",
      "The present study uses an approach that distinguishes four categories of health-related behaviors: (a) proper nutrition habits (eating proper food and keeping a well-balanced diet); (b) prophylaxis (obeying health recommendations and obtaining health and disease information); (c) positive attitude (avoiding emotional overload, stress, or depressing situations); and (d) pro-health practices (good sleeping habits, relaxation, and physical activity; Juczyński, 2009).\n",
      "The positive impact of health-related behavior on subjective well-being has already been the subject of studies on various age groups: adolescents (Shaffer-Hudkins, 2011; Sacker, 2012), university students (Binkowska-Bury et al., 2010), and older adults (Boswell et al., 2006). However, little is still known about the precise relationship between health-related behavior and psychological well-being. Moreover, there have been very few studies regarding the impact of spirituality on health-related behavior, although the former was recognized as one of four dimensions of health (Harris et al., 1999).\n",
      "\n",
      "Present Study\n",
      "The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between spirituality, health-related behavior, type of acquired education, and psychological well-being. To achieve this goal, a path analysis was conducted. It is considered one of a few possible statistical approaches addressing the problem of spirituality and health, recommended by Miller and Thoresen (2003). The path model helps to verify assumed relationships between a set of variables represented as a structure of the tested model, which is based on theoretical associations between the variables. It also provides a framework for the analysis of the direct, indirect, and total effects, whose form provides an analytical basis for interpreting moderation effects (Alwin and Hausner, 1975; Miller and Thoresen, 2003). Direct effects are regression coefficients representing the structural components of the model; indirect effects are parts of causal influence transmitted by intervening moderator and mediator variables; and total effects are the totals of direct and indirect effects (Alwin and Hausner, 1975; Pearl, 2012). It must be highlighted that although path analysis implies causality, it cannot be inferred from the gathered data since it is cross-sectional (Bollen and Pearl, 2013). The directions of the relations in the model were based on the mentioned literature, yet the model itself was not aimed at testing causal effects. The path analysis was used to disaggregate, quantify, and compare the magnitude of associations between the variables (Miller and Thoresen, 2003; Bollen and Pearl, 2013). \n",
      "The impact of spirituality on recovery from disease and the promotion of health is a topic that has received the attention of many researchers and scholars around the world. Spirituality is considered one of the natural capacities of humans that has positive effects on individuals’ health. The aim of this study was to review the impact of spirituality on people’s health and to discuss the relationship between health and belief in spiritual powers.\n",
      "Evidence Acquisition: This study comprised a non-systematic narrative review of original and reliable scientific articles on spirituality published from 1972 to 2014. The research strategy was carried out using electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar. Considering the goal of the research, 51 articles were selected and reviewed.\n",
      "Results: Most studies indicated the positive impact of spirituality on people’s health. Recourse to spiritual powers leads to reductions in anxiety and concern among patients and their families, and allows people to more easily accept and cope with their health disorders.\n",
      "Conclusions: To date, most of the studies conducted on the topic have confirmed the positive impact of religious beliefs and other spiritual approaches on health and the course of recovery from acute and chronic diseases. Based on these findings, medical personnel should turn their attention to the advantages of spirituality in relation to patients’ treatment and acquaint patients and their families with such spiritual benefits. \n",
      "Spirituality places far greater emphasis on human principles than religious practices, and indicates a person’s feelings about the meaning and goals of life beyond material values . Spirituality encompasses a series of meanings that underline aspiration, compatibility, vision, beliefs, and the meaningfulness of conditions . It is an inextricable element of human life and an important factor that enables humans to overcome numerous challenges. When considering spirituality, a different definition of health is given with respect to independent human identity. Traditionally, health represents humans’ biologic identity based on modern medical science and the principle definitions of health ; however, another identity is humans’ psychological or sympathetic perceptions, which constitute community health.\n",
      "During the 19th and first half of the 20th century, diseases were described as disorders in the body’s physiologic processes, a definition that remains dominant in medicine. In the second half of the 20th century, the indirect impact of physical and mental interaction on health status was officially recognized. Attention then turned to the question of why some individuals become ill frequently and have delayed recoveries. Presently, people are again considering that there is a relationship between spirituality and health. Religious beliefs and spirituality are deemed beneficial to the maintenance of physical and psychological health, a reality which, once more, revives the idea of the integration of the body and the psyche. Notwithstanding, the trend in medical science is inclined toward the dominant perspectives of religious outlook, which are free of extravagance and prejudice . All divine religions, particularly Islam, place special emphasis on the non-material aspects of life and draw attention to the spiritual life of mankind. Due to this capacity, Islam, as well as other monotheistic religions, play a key role in helping people cope with disease .\n",
      "As Imam Ali (May God’s greetings be upon him) stated 14 centuries ago, “Be aware that poverty is the greatest of all evils, and physical ill health is more severe than destitution, and worse still is illness of the heart, and remember that the greatest blessing is piety of the heart, followed by, in order of importance, bodily health and financial security.” Herein, sin and transgression are mentioned with respect to the ailing soul and heart . In addition, Imam Ali urged people to avoid scourges, hardships, and difficulties through prayer, a means that emphasizes the impact of prayer and praise to God on physical and psychological health .\n",
      "Imam Sadegh (May God’s greetings be upon him) said, “If any one of you gets caught up in one of the worldly sorrows, it isn’t difficult if he/she, after having prayer’s ablution (vozou) goes to the mosque, prays, and asks God to remove his/her sadness. Have you not heard that God has said, ‘Seek help from patience and praying’”.\n",
      "Nowadays, many studies regarding the connection between spirituality and health are in progress. Naturally, the topics discussed in this context comprise a series of criteria such as mortality, the eventual benchmark of health, living efficiency, and treatment. Additionally, it is thought that the different aspects of religion, as with most prominent aspects of spirituality, could have a positive impact on health . Thus, religious practices and acts of worship, especially at special times and in particular places, could lead to the regulation of the body’s important physiological reactions . Experimental results have largely been compatible with the perspective that, through different mechanisms, religion is an important factor in preventing many diseases and the promotion of health . Gallup’s opinion poll conducted in 1998 indicated that 60% of Americans reported religion to be of the utmost importance in their lives, and over 82% believed that they needed spiritual improvement, the survey thus confirming people’s considerable concern with spirituality . Such observations and results have redoubled the need to pay attention to the effect of religious beliefs on the psychological and physical health of people and their impact on trends of compliance, recovery, and the treatment of disease. The present study explores the latest findings on the impact of spirituality on physical and psychological health.\n",
      "Religious coping is the most common reaction to health problems and disorders . Patients who are spiritual may use their beliefs to cope with disease, pain, and stressful situations. Patients with spiritual vision have a more positive perspective on life and report a better quality of life  and well-being . One of the best examples of compliance with disease is based on evidence obtained from patients with different types of cancer . In such cases, patients cope more easily with their disease, are happier and more satisfied with their lives, and feel less pain  due to their spiritual beliefs and religious outlooks. Other evidence has shown that spirituality plays an important role in quality of health, especially among the elderly and those afflicted with non-communicable diseases .\n",
      "Studies have confirmed a connection between a spiritual lifestyle and people’s capacity to enjoy life, even when associated with symptoms of pain . The results of the distribution of pain questionnaire obtained from hospitalized patients in the United States showed that personal prayers are the most common non-medication approach to controlling pain . Prayer is therefore worth considering as a way to cope with pain.\n",
      "Having a spiritual vision can help patients comply with disease and confront death. In one study, 93% of 108 patients suffering from cancer cited their religious beliefs as a strategy for coping with cancer . In another study, 26.1% of the subjects with cancer, chronic pain, and heart disease stated that religious practice helped them deal with their illnesses . Notably, a relatively high proportion of these patients comprised those afflicted with cancer. In terms of Alzheimer’s disease, praying is the most important spiritual training used to tackle the disease . Additionally, among patients and their families prayer is a strategy for managing cancer pain . Studies of parents who had lost children to cancer confirmed the positive impact of spirituality on stress reduction and compliance with their conditions after the death of their children . Saying prayers also helps alleviate anxiety and concern in mothers of children suffering from cancer . This effect was confirmed by meditation groups as well as written statements from patients. The positive impact of yoga and spirituality on the relationship between the body and the psyche and the role played by psychology (mind) in the Indian community have been reported ; however, there were some ambiguities concerning the efficiency of the study.\n",
      " Recovery\n",
      "Recovery and convalescence following surgical operations are accelerated by spiritual commitments. Spirituality has been referred to as a positive and complementary approach to physical activity and treatment by physicians . Saying prayers as a practical manifestation of spirituality is effective in the treatment of many acute and chronic diseases . For example, heart transplant patients who participated in religious activities stated that their beliefs played an important role in their improved compliance with treatment, and they also exhibited higher levels of self-confidence, less anxiety and apprehension, and an improvement in physical performance over a period of 12 months . Similarly, people with spiritual vision have shown lower levels of depression, despair, and cognitive disorders, with positive recovery trends. By and large, people with less apprehension are healthier, and it seems likely that spirituality enables people to enjoy better health and to live better lives with less depression .\n",
      " Advantages of Familiarity With Patients’ Spiritual Vision\n",
      "Familiarity with the spiritual aspects of patients is beneficial to both patients and physicians. From most patients’ perspectives, a discussion with their physician about their beliefs is very beneficial; however, in practice, few physicians have such conversations with their patients. According to a study conducted at a lung hospital in Pennsylvania, 66% of patients indicated that their confidence in their physician was boosted when their physician queried their spiritual beliefs. In addition, 94% of patients who adhered to spiritual principles demanded that physicians consider their religious beliefs and the framework of their values, and as many as 50% of secular individuals stated that physicians must at least talk to patients with serious conditions about their religious beliefs .\n",
      "From physicians’ perspectives, knowledge about the spiritual vision of patients helps them understand the disease. Notably, religious beliefs may impact healthcare-related decision-making, which is important for the development of treatment strategies . In addition, evaluating the spiritual vision of patients alleviates their living problems. Therefore, a sound understanding of patients’ spiritual beliefs is inseparable from patient care . Table 1 presents excerpts from some reviewed studies on the relationship between spirituality and health categorized according to mortality, coping and compliance, and recovery.\n",

      "\t\taccording to research, those with an intrinsic religious orientation, regardless of gender, exhibited less physiological reactivity toward stress than those with an extrinsic religious orientation.4﻿ those who were intrinsically oriented dedicated their lives to god or a \"higher power,\" while the extrinsically oriented ones used religion for external ends like making friends or increasing community social standing.\n",
      "\n",
      "this, along with other research, demonstrates that there may be tangible and lasting benefits to maintaining involvement with a spiritual community. this involvement, along with the gratitude that can accompany spirituality, can be a buffer against stress and is linked to greater levels of physical health.\n",

      "\t\tpay attention to how you are feeling: part of embracing spirituality means also embracing what it means to be human, both the good and the bad. \n",
      "\t\tfocus on others: opening your heart, feeling empathy, and helping others are important aspects of spirituality.\n",
      "\t\tmeditate: try spending 10 to 15 minutes each morning engaged in some form of meditation.\n",
      "\t\tpractice gratitude: start a gratitude journal and record what you are grateful for each day. this can be a great reminder of what is most important to you and what brings you the greatest happiness.\n",
      "\t\ttry mindfulness: by becoming more mindful, you can become more aware and appreciative of the present. mindfulness encourages you to be less judgmental (both of yourself and others) and focus more on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or future.\n",
      "visualization meditation is a powerful way to use the mind to influence the body and can also be an empowering way to manifest desired outcomes in your life. deepak chopra teaches that what we place our attention on grows stronger and what we take our attention away from will begin to diminish. the unconscious mind is extremely powerful and it works very well with imagery.\n",
      "one common visualization practice is centered around health. by visualizing your body-mind as being healthy, vibrant, and energized—or grounded, peaceful, and calm—you can begin to elicit these things both mentally and physically. another approach is using visual imagery for creative purposes. by constructing an image in your mind of what your life might look like after having accomplished a goal and really seeing yourself having already achieved it is a way to begin living in ways that support the manifestation of your desired outcome.\n",
      "to meditate using visual imagery, practice the following:\n",
      "\t1\tidentify your desired outcome. for example, do you wish to feel more grounded and at peace in your mind and emotions? or would you like to envision your physical body as being healthy, vibrant, and strong? or are you longing to create art, write poetry, be in a new relationship, or travel abroad?\n",
      "\t2\tcreate an internal representation of what this looks, sounds, and feels like. make it as real and as compelling as possible.\n",
      "\t3\tenter into a meditative state by relaxing and taking some deep breaths and then bring the image into your awareness. associate yourself into the picture by stepping inside it and feeling as if it has already happened.\n",
      "\t4\twhen it's time to come out of meditation, simply allow the image to fade off into the distance and relinquish any attachment to the outcome.\n",

      "japa or mantra-based meditation\n",
      "japa meditation is a mantra-based meditation path that is one of the oldest, most revered classical techniques known today. the word “mantra” translates to mind vehicle or mind instrument. japa meditation has the practitioner repeating a word or phrase for the duration of the meditation, with the mantra being the focal point throughout.\n",
      "during the practice, whenever you drift away from the mantra to other thoughts, sounds, or physical sensations, you simply guide your focus back to the repetition of the mantra. think of it as a dance back and forth between mantra and thought. some mantras have a specific meaning and it’s said that by repeating the mantra, you are connecting to the energetic essence of its intention.\n",
      "other mantras purposely have no meaning and are designed to help access deeper levels of silence. in this approach, eventually, the mantra and thoughts will cancel one another out. when this happens, your conscious awareness transcends the busyness of the mind and reaches higher states of consciousness.\n",
      "popular styles of mantra-based meditation are primordial sound meditation as taught by deepak chopra and the age-old practice of the so hum meditation. both of these practices are easily learned in person or online for your convenience.\n",
      "loving-kindness or metta meditation\n",
      "metta meditation, also known as loving-kindness meditation, is designed to cultivate four qualities of love: friendliness (metta), compassion (karuna), appreciative joy (mudita), and equanimity (upekkha). the quality of metta, or friendliness, is expressed as genuine compassion sent out with the intention of surrounding ourselves and others with loving-kindness. with all that is going on in the world today, metta meditation is a worthwhile practice for each of us to spend some time in each day. this style of meditation also works well as an entrance point for the practice of forgiveness and can be a powerful tool for lessening the charge of negative emotions we have toward those who have wronged us.\n",
      "while there are various approaches to metta meditation, this audio clip on loving kindness meditation is a thorough and well-spoken version.\n",
      "another variation will have you think silently to yourself, “may i be filled with loving-kindness. may i be well. may i be peaceful and at ease. may i be truly happy.” you would then bring someone else into your mind (someone you love and/or someone who you are feeling challenged by) and say silently, \"may you be filled with loving-kindness. may you be well. may you be peaceful and at ease. may you be truly happy.” you may then bring all of humanity into your awareness and send the same intention out to the collective—to all sentient beings, “may we be filled with loving-kindness. may we be well. may we be peaceful and at ease. may we be truly happy.”\n",
      "once you have done this meditation a few times and you remember the process, you can begin to do the meditation on your own without listening to the audio file. choose whatever language you prefer to use and practice this meditation for a period of time to see how it resonates with you.\n",
      "breath-awareness meditation\n",
      "breath-awareness meditation is a simple practice of finding a comfortable seat, closing your eyes, and placing your attention in the inhalation and exhalation of your breath. breath awareness is an effective way to establish a greater mind-body connection and to reduce stress. this form of meditation can be your preferred meditation practice each day and it is also a highly useful way to calm you down during any moment of tension in the workplace and at home.\n",
      "once you’ve tried a few different types of meditation, you will have a better idea of what resonates with you and what doesn't. the most important thing to remember is that there is no right or wrong meditation; there are many paths that all lead to the same destination, and the beauty of life is that we get to choose our own path.\n",
      "keep it simple at the beginning and just feel out some different techniques. when you find a routine that you enjoy, the next step is to set aside 15 to 20 minutes each day to cultivate your meditative practice. from there, tend to your practice each day and you will experience a number of life-changing benefits to your health and well-being.\n",
      "on a surface level, the mental body is your thoughts. on a deeper level, it is the domain of your beliefs, desires, values, and goals. beliefs are opinions and convictions that we hold as being true without having immediate proof. values represent what we hold internally as most important in an area of life. values and beliefs can come from thoughts that were formed very early in childhood.\n",
      "we all have desires to achieve or acquire something in our lives, which is why we set goals and intentions to help us get where we want to go. some surface-level thoughts, which may create goals or desires, direct our mental focus from moment to moment. this is how our logical, linear minds learn and operate, and it is one of the aspects of ourselves that is most familiar to us.\n",
      "as energy flows down from the mental body into the emotional body, it can bump into stored baggage from the past and create some turbulence. stored baggage can come from past fears, which can project into the future and cause anxiety. or, it can come from experiencing a lot of anger or resentment toward someone, which can cause anger or resentment later in life when familiar conditions repeat. you may even develop negative beliefs about people.\n",

      "we found four relevant publications, including two reviews on the effects of yoga on depression , a description of studies on yogic breathing  for depression, and one “summary” . the reviewing authors have reported that the studies reviewed showed a large variety of diagnoses ranging from “major depression or some other type of diagnosed depression” to “elevated depressive symptoms” . although several randomized controlled trials (rcts) reported beneficial effects of yoga interventions for treating depressive symptoms, the quality and quantity of the data from these studies appear insufficient to conclude whether there is substantial clinical justification to consider yoga as a treatment of depression. compared to passive controls, the yoga interventions seem to be effective; when compared with active controls, not surprisingly, the effects are less conclusive . the study results are so far not sufficient in quantity and quality to determine whether studies with a focus on the asanas are more effective as compared to studies with meditation-focussed or pranayama-focussed styles. thus, there is a strong need to conduct more conclusive studies with high methodological quality and larger patient samples. whether motivation of depressed patients could be a problem or not remains to be clarified. there has been an attempt to explore mechanisms of action and to understand the complete picture of the effects of yoga in depression looking at electrophysiological markers of attention, and neurotransmitters which were found to change with yoga [7, 31].\n",

      "studies suggest a positive association of spirituality and health behaviors with well-being (especially subjective well-being), but still the precise character of such relationships between all these constructs remains unknown. the present study aims to explore the relations between spirituality, health-related behaviors, and psychological well-being in the context of acquired education. a questionnaire survey was conducted among 595 students from six different universities, whose study programs either focused on the human body or the human mind and spirit. path analysis and linear regression were used to model the relationship between the examined constructs. the results show that both spirituality and health-related behaviors are positively related to psychological well-being, and that the relationship with spirituality is also mediated by health-related behaviors. only spirituality is associated with the type of acquired education, especially in the group of students whose studies focus on the human mind and spirit. moreover, spirituality in this group seems to display a stronger relationship with psychological well-being. these findings may contribute to the better understanding of some significant determinants of psychological well-being. they carry important implications for the faculty members responsible for curriculum preparation to account for teaching contents related to the conduct of a healthy lifestyle and to spiritual development.\n",

      "introduction\n",
      "almost 20 years ago, following the commencement of the positive psychology movement, the research approach in the areas of psychology, especially those concerning mental health, began to change, concentrating on a much greater interest in well-being than on mere diseases or disorders (bhullar et al., 2014). two main directions have emerged in well-being research: one based on a hedonistic approach and the other on eudaimonia. according to the hedonistic approach, well-being is concerned with affective pleasure in someone’s life (watson et al., 1988). the term subjective well-being (swb) is used in positive psychology in the sense of a high level of positive affect, a low level of negative affect, and a high degree of satisfaction with one’s life (deci and ryan, 2008). in contrast, in the eudaemonist approach, well-being is perceived as the degree to which people function so that they could realize their full potential (waterman, 1993). in publications on positive psychology eudaimonism is often synonymous with psychological well-being (pwb; ryan and deci, 2001).\n",
      "\n",
      "recently, the main direction in studies of determinants of well-being has focused on subjective well-being (diener, 2000). demographic determinants (argyle, 1999), cognitive and motivational determinants (lyubomirsky, 2001), and personality determinants (park, et al., 2004) of subjective well-being have been identified. less attention is currently paid to psychological well-being, however, some research indicated religion and spirituality to be significant pwb implications (levin and chatters, 1998; lawler-row and elliott, 2009) and revealed associations between pro-health behaviors, spirituality, and well-being (boswell et al., 2006). at present, in a holistic view of health beyond biological and psychosocial well-being, the spiritual dimension of well-being is frequently discussed. this new construct is defined as a sense of connection with others, sense of life, and relationship with a transcendent force. it has psychosocial and religious components, and it is believed to promote spiritual health (ghaderi et al., 2018; alborzi et al., 2019). the present study attempts to gain a better insight into relationships between spirituality, health-related behavior, and psychological well-being with regard to the type of acquired education.\n",
      "\n",
      "theoretical background\n",
      "psychological well-being\n",
      "the answer to the question “what does it mean to feel well psychologically?” needs to be sought in literature on humanistic psychology, including developmental and health psychology (ryff, 1989). ryff created a multidimensional construct of well-being, building on such concepts as basic life tendencies of buhler (1935), psychosocial stages of erikson (1959), personality changes of neugarten (1973), positive criteria of mental health of jahoda (1958), account of individuation of jung (1933), formulation of maturity of allport (1961), depiction of the fully-functioning person of rogers (1961), and notion of self-actualization of maslow (1968).\n",
      "psychological well-being covers a wide range of welfare including positive assessments of oneself and one’s past life (self-acceptance), a sense of continued growth and development as a person (personal growth), the belief that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful (purpose in life), the possession of quality relations with others (positive relations with others), the capacity to manage effectively one’s life and the surrounding world (environmental mastery), and a sense of self-determination (autonomy; ryff and keyes, 1995, p. 720). ryff and singer (1998) also developed a measure to assess the above six distinct factors of positive psychological functioning.\n",
      "both the model and the measure came under review. the former was criticized for the lack of independence of individual scales (springer and hausner, 2006). according to various researchers, personal growth, purpose in life, self-acceptance, and environmental mastery do form a single scale. the latter was criticized for its lack of factorial validity or internal consistency (van dierendonck, 2004). however, some other studies supported the six-factor pwb model (ryff and singer, 2006; van dierendonck et al., 2008) and also revealed the existence of a single higher-order pwb factor above the subscales (keyes et al., 2002).\n",
      "the concept of pwb corresponds to the who definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, formulated in 1948 (who, 1948). a high level of pwb is associated with a lower risk of depression (ryff and keyes, 1995; fava, 1999), a lower possibility of displaying risk behavior (yonker et al., 2012), and a decreased immune cell expression of a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (ctra; fredrickson et al., 2015).\n",
      "spirituality\n",
      "according to joseph et al. (2017, p. 506), spirituality should be understood as “a more general, unstructured, personalized, and naturally occurring phenomenon, where a person seeks closeness and/or connectedness between him/herself and a higher power or purpose.” other authors define spirituality in terms of search for universal truth and as an activity enabling people to discover meaning and significance in the surrounding world (woods and ironson, 1999). spirituality can also be perceived as a dynamic reality, constantly exploring something new; it may also involve the learning of the ultimate boundaries of existence and seeking a broader meaning of life. hart (1994, p. 23) defined spirituality as a way in which an individual experiences his or her faith in everyday life and style “in which the individual refers to the final conditions of individual existence.”\n",
      "spirituality therefore forms a multidimensional theoretical construct. in essence, it constitutes transcendence understood as going beyond or above “the real i.” in this context, spirituality is defined as experiencing transcendence through inner peace, harmony, or connectedness to others (boswell et al., 2006). transcendence can take place both within the person (self-realization, self-improvement, and personal development) and outside the person. “external” transcendence may be directed to a higher entity or energy; to another person, claimed to be of particular value, whose good is more important than one’s own good; or to the universe (heszen-niejodek and gruszyńska, 2004). spirituality differs from religion as the latter is rather linked with specific rituals, institutional dependencies, and social relationships, whereas the former is more about personal experience of what is unseen and recognized as greater than ourselves (tovar-murray, 2011). thoresen (1998) claims that religion is perceived mainly as a social phenomenon, while spirituality is usually considered at the individual level and within a specific context. despite their common transcendence-related roots, spirituality and religiosity may not be treated interchangeably. these are different areas, however, overlapping in their meaning (krok, 2009a).\n",
      "heszen-niejodek and gruszyńska (2004) understand transcendence as a common denominator for many concepts of spirituality. the two-way understanding of transcendence, described above as self-improvement and as a turn toward a higher-being, makes it possible to examine the phenomenon of spirituality using the methodology of psychological sciences, without questioning theological and philosophical perspectives (krok, 2009a).\n",
      "studies demonstrated the positive impact of spirituality on physical health and mental health as well as on other positive health outcomes such as subjective well-being, health-related quality of life, coping skills, recovering from mental illness, or less addictive or suicidal behaviors (mueller et al., 2001; miller and thoresen, 2003; kharitonov, 2012; unterrainer et al., 2014). however, we must bear in mind that spirituality is a complex construct and as such it is defined in multiple ways and measured with different tools (lun and bond, 2013).\n",
      "in our study, we used the self-reported questionnaire by heszen-niejodek and gruszyńska (2004), in which the overall factor spirituality consists of religious attitudes (religious experiences, their importance in everyday life, their influence on moral choices and behavior, and relationship to god); ethical sensitivity (high place of ethical values in the hierarchy of values, our compliance with them, and tendency toward ethical reflection); and harmony (seeking harmony with the world, internal consistency, and cohesion of various forms of one’s own activity). these dimensions reflect the main manifestations of spirituality available in internal experience, distinguished on the basis of descriptions of specific manifestations of spirituality in psychological literature (hill et al., 2000; socha, 2000; thoresen and harris, 2002), subsequently ordered according to the aforementioned directions of transcendence (me, god, other people, and the world).\n",
      "health-related behavior\n",
      "lifestyle and lifestyle-related health behaviors are some of the determinants of health potential (binkowska-bury et al., 2010). a health behavior is any activity undertaken to prevent or detect disease or to improve health and well-being (conner and norman, 1996). in studies on health behavior and behavioral change, health behaviors are usually divided into those associated with physical activity, diet, and the use of psychoactive substances (norman et al., 2008). however, there are currently other more popular approaches that consider multiple lifestyle-forming health behaviors, between which different interactions take place (op. cit).\n",
      "the present study uses an approach that distinguishes four categories of health-related behaviors: (a) proper nutrition habits (eating proper food and keeping a well-balanced diet); (b) prophylaxis (obeying health recommendations and obtaining health and disease information); (c) positive attitude (avoiding emotional overload, stress, or depressing situations); and (d) pro-health practices (good sleeping habits, relaxation, and physical activity; juczyński, 2009).\n",
      "the positive impact of health-related behavior on subjective well-being has already been the subject of studies on various age groups: adolescents (shaffer-hudkins, 2011; sacker, 2012), university students (binkowska-bury et al., 2010), and older adults (boswell et al., 2006). however, little is still known about the precise relationship between health-related behavior and psychological well-being. moreover, there have been very few studies regarding the impact of spirituality on health-related behavior, although the former was recognized as one of four dimensions of health (harris et al., 1999).\n",
      "\n",
      "present study\n",
      "the main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between spirituality, health-related behavior, type of acquired education, and psychological well-being. to achieve this goal, a path analysis was conducted. it is considered one of a few possible statistical approaches addressing the problem of spirituality and health, recommended by miller and thoresen (2003). the path model helps to verify assumed relationships between a set of variables represented as a structure of the tested model, which is based on theoretical associations between the variables. it also provides a framework for the analysis of the direct, indirect, and total effects, whose form provides an analytical basis for interpreting moderation effects (alwin and hausner, 1975; miller and thoresen, 2003). direct effects are regression coefficients representing the structural components of the model; indirect effects are parts of causal influence transmitted by intervening moderator and mediator variables; and total effects are the totals of direct and indirect effects (alwin and hausner, 1975; pearl, 2012). it must be highlighted that although path analysis implies causality, it cannot be inferred from the gathered data since it is cross-sectional (bollen and pearl, 2013). the directions of the relations in the model were based on the mentioned literature, yet the model itself was not aimed at testing causal effects. the path analysis was used to disaggregate, quantify, and compare the magnitude of associations between the variables (miller and thoresen, 2003; bollen and pearl, 2013). \n",
      "the impact of spirituality on recovery from disease and the promotion of health is a topic that has received the attention of many researchers and scholars around the world. spirituality is considered one of the natural capacities of humans that has positive effects on individuals’ health. the aim of this study was to review the impact of spirituality on people’s health and to discuss the relationship between health and belief in spiritual powers.\n",
      "evidence acquisition: this study comprised a non-systematic narrative review of original and reliable scientific articles on spirituality published from 1972 to 2014. the research strategy was carried out using electronic databases such as scopus, pubmed, and google scholar. considering the goal of the research, 51 articles were selected and reviewed.\n",
      "results: most studies indicated the positive impact of spirituality on people’s health. recourse to spiritual powers leads to reductions in anxiety and concern among patients and their families, and allows people to more easily accept and cope with their health disorders.\n",
      "conclusions: to date, most of the studies conducted on the topic have confirmed the positive impact of religious beliefs and other spiritual approaches on health and the course of recovery from acute and chronic diseases. based on these findings, medical personnel should turn their attention to the advantages of spirituality in relation to patients’ treatment and acquaint patients and their families with such spiritual benefits. \n",
      "spirituality places far greater emphasis on human principles than religious practices, and indicates a person’s feelings about the meaning and goals of life beyond material values . spirituality encompasses a series of meanings that underline aspiration, compatibility, vision, beliefs, and the meaningfulness of conditions . it is an inextricable element of human life and an important factor that enables humans to overcome numerous challenges. when considering spirituality, a different definition of health is given with respect to independent human identity. traditionally, health represents humans’ biologic identity based on modern medical science and the principle definitions of health ; however, another identity is humans’ psychological or sympathetic perceptions, which constitute community health.\n",
      "during the 19th and first half of the 20th century, diseases were described as disorders in the body’s physiologic processes, a definition that remains dominant in medicine. in the second half of the 20th century, the indirect impact of physical and mental interaction on health status was officially recognized. attention then turned to the question of why some individuals become ill frequently and have delayed recoveries. presently, people are again considering that there is a relationship between spirituality and health. religious beliefs and spirituality are deemed beneficial to the maintenance of physical and psychological health, a reality which, once more, revives the idea of the integration of the body and the psyche. notwithstanding, the trend in medical science is inclined toward the dominant perspectives of religious outlook, which are free of extravagance and prejudice . all divine religions, particularly islam, place special emphasis on the non-material aspects of life and draw attention to the spiritual life of mankind. due to this capacity, islam, as well as other monotheistic religions, play a key role in helping people cope with disease .\n",
      "as imam ali (may god’s greetings be upon him) stated 14 centuries ago, “be aware that poverty is the greatest of all evils, and physical ill health is more severe than destitution, and worse still is illness of the heart, and remember that the greatest blessing is piety of the heart, followed by, in order of importance, bodily health and financial security.” herein, sin and transgression are mentioned with respect to the ailing soul and heart . in addition, imam ali urged people to avoid scourges, hardships, and difficulties through prayer, a means that emphasizes the impact of prayer and praise to god on physical and psychological health .\n",
      "imam sadegh (may god’s greetings be upon him) said, “if any one of you gets caught up in one of the worldly sorrows, it isn’t difficult if he/she, after having prayer’s ablution (vozou) goes to the mosque, prays, and asks god to remove his/her sadness. have you not heard that god has said, ‘seek help from patience and praying’”.\n",
      "nowadays, many studies regarding the connection between spirituality and health are in progress. naturally, the topics discussed in this context comprise a series of criteria such as mortality, the eventual benchmark of health, living efficiency, and treatment. additionally, it is thought that the different aspects of religion, as with most prominent aspects of spirituality, could have a positive impact on health . thus, religious practices and acts of worship, especially at special times and in particular places, could lead to the regulation of the body’s important physiological reactions . experimental results have largely been compatible with the perspective that, through different mechanisms, religion is an important factor in preventing many diseases and the promotion of health . gallup’s opinion poll conducted in 1998 indicated that 60% of americans reported religion to be of the utmost importance in their lives, and over 82% believed that they needed spiritual improvement, the survey thus confirming people’s considerable concern with spirituality . such observations and results have redoubled the need to pay attention to the effect of religious beliefs on the psychological and physical health of people and their impact on trends of compliance, recovery, and the treatment of disease. the present study explores the latest findings on the impact of spirituality on physical and psychological health.\n",
      "religious coping is the most common reaction to health problems and disorders . patients who are spiritual may use their beliefs to cope with disease, pain, and stressful situations. patients with spiritual vision have a more positive perspective on life and report a better quality of life  and well-being . one of the best examples of compliance with disease is based on evidence obtained from patients with different types of cancer . in such cases, patients cope more easily with their disease, are happier and more satisfied with their lives, and feel less pain  due to their spiritual beliefs and religious outlooks. other evidence has shown that spirituality plays an important role in quality of health, especially among the elderly and those afflicted with non-communicable diseases .\n",
      "studies have confirmed a connection between a spiritual lifestyle and people’s capacity to enjoy life, even when associated with symptoms of pain . the results of the distribution of pain questionnaire obtained from hospitalized patients in the united states showed that personal prayers are the most common non-medication approach to controlling pain . prayer is therefore worth considering as a way to cope with pain.\n",
      "having a spiritual vision can help patients comply with disease and confront death. in one study, 93% of 108 patients suffering from cancer cited their religious beliefs as a strategy for coping with cancer . in another study, 26.1% of the subjects with cancer, chronic pain, and heart disease stated that religious practice helped them deal with their illnesses . notably, a relatively high proportion of these patients comprised those afflicted with cancer. in terms of alzheimer’s disease, praying is the most important spiritual training used to tackle the disease . additionally, among patients and their families prayer is a strategy for managing cancer pain . studies of parents who had lost children to cancer confirmed the positive impact of spirituality on stress reduction and compliance with their conditions after the death of their children . saying prayers also helps alleviate anxiety and concern in mothers of children suffering from cancer . this effect was confirmed by meditation groups as well as written statements from patients. the positive impact of yoga and spirituality on the relationship between the body and the psyche and the role played by psychology (mind) in the indian community have been reported ; however, there were some ambiguities concerning the efficiency of the study.\n",
      " recovery\n",
      "recovery and convalescence following surgical operations are accelerated by spiritual commitments. spirituality has been referred to as a positive and complementary approach to physical activity and treatment by physicians . saying prayers as a practical manifestation of spirituality is effective in the treatment of many acute and chronic diseases . for example, heart transplant patients who participated in religious activities stated that their beliefs played an important role in their improved compliance with treatment, and they also exhibited higher levels of self-confidence, less anxiety and apprehension, and an improvement in physical performance over a period of 12 months . similarly, people with spiritual vision have shown lower levels of depression, despair, and cognitive disorders, with positive recovery trends. by and large, people with less apprehension are healthier, and it seems likely that spirituality enables people to enjoy better health and to live better lives with less depression .\n",
      " advantages of familiarity with patients’ spiritual vision\n",
      "familiarity with the spiritual aspects of patients is beneficial to both patients and physicians. from most patients’ perspectives, a discussion with their physician about their beliefs is very beneficial; however, in practice, few physicians have such conversations with their patients. according to a study conducted at a lung hospital in pennsylvania, 66% of patients indicated that their confidence in their physician was boosted when their physician queried their spiritual beliefs. in addition, 94% of patients who adhered to spiritual principles demanded that physicians consider their religious beliefs and the framework of their values, and as many as 50% of secular individuals stated that physicians must at least talk to patients with serious conditions about their religious beliefs .\n",
      "from physicians’ perspectives, knowledge about the spiritual vision of patients helps them understand the disease. notably, religious beliefs may impact healthcare-related decision-making, which is important for the development of treatment strategies . in addition, evaluating the spiritual vision of patients alleviates their living problems. therefore, a sound understanding of patients’ spiritual beliefs is inseparable from patient care . table 1 presents excerpts from some reviewed studies on the relationship between spirituality and health categorized according to mortality, coping and compliance, and recovery.\n",

restore hope and optimism: Spirituality can help people develop a more hopeful outlook on life.', 'To find a sense of community and support: Because spiritual traditions often involve organized religions or groups, becoming a part of such a group can serve as an important source of social support.', 'Impact of Spirituality\\nWhile specific spiritual views are a matter of faith, research has demonstrated some of the benefits of spirituality and spiritual activity.', 'The results may surprise no one who has found comfort in their religious or spiritual views, but they are definitely noteworthy in that they demonstrate in a scientific way that these activities do have benefits for many people.', 'The following are a few more of the many positive findings related to spirituality and its influence on physical and mental health:\\n\\n\\t\\tResearch has shown that religion and spirituality can help people cope with the effects of everyday stress.', 'One study found that everyday spiritual experiences helped older adults better cope with negative feelings and enhanced positive feelings.', 'Research shows that older women are more grateful to God than older men, and they receive greater stress-buffering health effects due to this gratitude.3\\ufeff\\n\\t\\tAccording to research, those with an intrinsic religious orientation, regardless of gender, exhibited less physiological reactivity toward stress than those with an extrinsic religious orientation.4\\ufeff Those who were intrinsically oriented dedicated their lives to God or a \"higher power,\" while the extrinsically oriented ones used religion for external ends like making friends or increasing community social standing.', 'This, along with other research, demonstrates that there may be tangible and lasting benefits to maintaining involvement with a spiritual community.', 'This involvement, along with the gratitude that can accompany spirituality, can be a buffer against stress and is linked to greater levels of physical health.', 'Dedication to God or a \"higher power\" translated into less stress reactivity, greater feelings of well-being, and ultimately even a decreased fear of death.', \"People who feel comfortable and comforted using spirituality as a coping mechanism for stress can rest assured that there's even more evidence that this is a good idea for them.\", 'Prayer works for

what it means to be human, both the good and the bad.', 'Focus on others: Opening your heart, feeling empathy, and helping others are important aspects of spirituality.', 'Meditate: Try spending 10 to 15 minutes each morning engaged in some form of meditation.', 'Practice gratitude: Start a gratitude journal and record what you are grateful for each day.', 'This can be a great reminder of what is most important to you and what brings you the greatest happiness.', 'Try mindfulness: By becoming more mindful, you can become more aware and appreciative of the present.', 'Mindfulness encourages you to be less judgmental (both of yourself and others) and focus more on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or future.', 'Visualization meditation is a powerful way to use the mind to influence the body and can also be an empowering way to manifest desired outcomes in your life.', 'Deepak Chopra teaches that what we place our attention on grows stronger and what we take our

visualizing your body-mind as being healthy, vibrant, and energized—or grounded, peaceful, and calm—you can begin to elicit these things both mentally and physically.', 'Another approach is using visual imagery for creative purposes.', 'By constructing an image in your mind of what your life might look like after having accomplished a goal and really seeing yourself having already achieved it is a way to begin living in ways that support the manifestation of your desired outcome.', 'To meditate using visual imagery, practice the following:\\n\\t1\\tIdentify your desired outcome.', 'For example, do you wish to feel more grounded and at peace in your mind and emotions?', 'Or would you like to envision your physical body as being healthy, vibrant, and strong?', 'Or are you longing to create art, write poetry, be in a new relationship, or travel abroad?', '2\\tCreate an internal representation of what this looks, sounds, and feels like.', 'Make it as real and as compelling as

yourself, “May I be filled with loving-kindness.', 'May I be well.', 'May I be peaceful and at ease.', 'May I be truly happy.” You would then bring someone else into your mind (someone you love and/or someone who you are feeling challenged by) and say silently, \"May you be filled with loving-kindness.', 'May you be well.', 'May you be peaceful and at ease.', 'May you be truly happy.” You may then

findings may contribute to the better understanding of some significant determinants of psychological well-being.', 'They carry important implications for the faculty members responsible for curriculum preparation to account for teaching contents related to the conduct of a healthy lifestyle and to spiritual development.', 'Introduction\\nAlmost 20 years ago, following the commencement of the positive psychology movement, the research approach in the areas of psychology, especially those concerning mental health, began to change, concentrating on a much greater interest in well-being than on mere diseases or disorders (Bhullar et al., 2014).', 'Two main directions have emerged in well-being research: one based on a hedonistic approach and the other on eudaimonia.', 'According to the hedonistic approach, well-being is concerned with affective pleasure in someone’s life (Watson et al., 1988).', 'The term subjective well-being (SWB) is used in positive psychology in the sense of a high level of positive affect, a low level of negative affect, and a high degree of satisfaction with one’s life (Deci and Ryan, 2008).', 'In contrast, in the eudaemonist approach, well-being is perceived as the degree to which people function so that they could realize their full potential (Waterman, 1993).', 'In publications on positive psychology eudaimonism is often synonymous with psychological well-being (PWB; Ryan and Deci, 2001).', 'Recently, the main direction in studies of determinants of well-being has focused on subjective well-being (Diener, 2000).', 'Demographic determinants (Argyle, 1999), cognitive and motivational determinants (Lyubomirsky, 2001), and personality determinants (Park, et al., 2004) of subjective well-being have been identified.', 'Less attention is currently paid to psychological well-being, however, some research indicated religion and spirituality to be significant PWB implications (Levin and Chatters, 1998; Lawler-Row and Elliott, 2009) and revealed associations between pro-health behaviors, spirituality, and well-being (Boswell et al., 2006).', 'At present, in a holistic view of health beyond biological and psychosocial well-being, the spiritual dimension of well-being is frequently discussed.', 'This new construct is defined as a sense of connection with others, sense of life, and relationship with a transcendent force.', 'It has psychosocial and religious components, and it is believed to promote spiritual health (Ghaderi et al., 2018; Alborzi et al., 2019).', 'The present study attempts to gain a better insight into relationships between spirituality, health-related behavior, and psychological well-being with regard to the type of acquired education.', 'Theoretical Background\\nPsychological Well-Being\\nThe answer to the question “What does it mean to feel well psychologically?” needs to be sought in literature on humanistic psychology, including developmental and health psychology (Ryff, 1989).', 'Ryff created a multidimensional construct of well-being, building on such concepts as basic life tendencies of Buhler (1935), psychosocial stages of Erikson (1959), personality changes of Neugarten (1973), positive criteria of mental health of Jahoda (1958), account of individuation of Jung (1933), formulation of maturity of Allport (1961), depiction of the fully-functioning person of Rogers (1961), and notion of self-actualization of Maslow (1968).', 'Psychological well-being covers a wide range of welfare including positive assessments of oneself and one’s past life (Self-Acceptance), a sense of continued growth and development as a person (Personal Growth), the belief that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful (Purpose in Life), the possession of quality relations with others (Positive Relations With Others), the capacity to manage effectively one’s life and the surrounding world (Environmental Mastery), and a sense of self-determination (Autonomy; Ryff and Keyes, 1995, p. 720).', 'Ryff and Singer (1998) also developed a measure to assess the above six distinct factors of positive psychological functioning.', 'Both the model and the measure came under review.', 'The former was criticized for the lack of independence of individual scales (Springer and Hausner, 2006).', 'According to various researchers, Personal Growth, Purpose in Life, Self-Acceptance, and Environmental Mastery do form a single scale.', 'The latter was criticized for its lack of factorial validity or internal consistency (van Dierendonck, 2004).', 'However, some other studies supported the six-factor PWB model (Ryff and Singer, 2006; van Dierendonck et al., 2008) and also revealed the existence of a single higher-order PWB factor above the subscales (Keyes et al., 2002).', 'The concept of PWB corresponds to the WHO definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, formulated in 1948 (WHO, 1948).', 'A high level of PWB is associated with a lower risk of depression (Ryff and Keyes, 1995; Fava, 1999), a lower possibility of displaying risk behavior (Yonker et al., 2012), and a decreased immune cell expression of a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA; Fredrickson et al., 2015).', 'Spirituality\\nAccording to Joseph et al.', '(2017, p. 506), spirituality should be understood as “a more general, unstructured, personalized, and naturally occurring phenomenon, where a person seeks closeness and/or connectedness between him/herself and a higher power or purpose.” Other authors define spirituality in terms of search for universal truth and as an activity enabling people to discover meaning and significance in the surrounding world (Woods and Ironson, 1999).', 'Spirituality can also be perceived as a dynamic reality, constantly exploring something new; it may also involve the learning of the ultimate boundaries of existence and seeking a broader meaning of life.', 'Hart (1994, p. 23) defined spirituality as a way in which an individual experiences his or her faith in everyday life and style “in which the individual refers to the final conditions of individual existence.”\\nSpirituality therefore forms a multidimensional theoretical construct.', 'In essence, it constitutes transcendence understood as going beyond or above “the real I.” In this context, spirituality is defined as experiencing transcendence through inner peace, harmony, or connectedness to others (Boswell et al., 2006).', 'Transcendence can take place both within the person (self-realization, self-improvement, and personal development) and outside the person.', '“External” transcendence may be directed to a higher entity or energy; to another person, claimed to be of particular value, whose good is more important than one’s own good; or to the universe (Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska, 2004).', 'Spirituality differs from religion as the latter is rather linked with specific rituals, institutional dependencies, and social relationships, whereas the former is more about personal experience of what is unseen and recognized as greater than ourselves (Tovar-Murray, 2011).', 'Thoresen (1998) claims that religion is perceived mainly as a social phenomenon, while spirituality is usually considered at the individual level and within a specific context.', 'Despite their common transcendence-related roots, spirituality and religiosity may not be treated interchangeably.', 'These are different areas, however, overlapping in their meaning (Krok, 2009a).', 'Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska (2004) understand transcendence as a common denominator for many concepts of spirituality.', 'The two-way understanding of transcendence, described above as self-improvement and as a turn toward a higher-being, makes it possible to examine the phenomenon of spirituality using the methodology of psychological sciences, without questioning theological and philosophical perspectives (Krok, 2009a).', 'Studies demonstrated the positive impact of spirituality on physical health and mental health as well as on other positive health outcomes such as subjective well-being, health-related quality of life, coping skills, recovering from mental illness, or less addictive or suicidal behaviors (Mueller et al., 2001; Miller and Thoresen, 2003; Kharitonov, 2012; Unterrainer et al., 2014).', 'However, we must bear in mind that spirituality is a complex construct and as such it is defined in multiple ways and measured with different tools (Lun and Bond, 2013).', 'In our study, we used the Self-Reported Questionnaire by Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska (2004), in which the overall factor Spirituality consists of Religious Attitudes (religious experiences, their importance in everyday life, their influence on moral choices and behavior, and relationship to God); Ethical Sensitivity (high place of ethical values in the hierarchy of values, our compliance with them, and tendency toward ethical reflection); and Harmony (seeking harmony with the world, internal consistency, and cohesion of various forms of one’s own activity).', 'These dimensions reflect the main manifestations of spirituality available in internal experience, distinguished on the basis of descriptions of specific manifestations of spirituality in psychological literature (Hill et al., 2000; Socha, 2000; Thoresen and Harris, 2002), subsequently ordered according to the aforementioned directions of transcendence (me, God, other people, and the world).', 'Health-Related Behavior\\nLifestyle and lifestyle-related health behaviors are some of the determinants of health potential (Binkowska-Bury et al., 2010).', 'A health behavior is any activity undertaken to prevent or detect disease or to improve health and well-being (Conner and Norman, 1996).', 'In studies on health behavior and behavioral change, health behaviors are usually divided into those associated with physical activity, diet, and the use of psychoactive substances (Norman et al., 2008).', 'However, there are currently other more popular approaches that consider multiple lifestyle-forming health behaviors, between which different interactions take place (op.', 'cit).', 'The present study uses an approach that distinguishes four categories of health-related behaviors: (a) proper nutrition habits (eating proper food and keeping a well-balanced diet); (b) prophylaxis (obeying health recommendations and obtaining health and disease information); (c) positive attitude (avoiding emotional overload, stress, or depressing situations); and (d) pro-health practices (good sleeping habits, relaxation, and physical activity; Juczyński, 2009).', 'The positive impact of health-related behavior on subjective well-being has already been the subject of studies on various age groups: adolescents (Shaffer-Hudkins, 2011; Sacker, 2012), university students (Binkowska-Bury et al., 2010), and older adults (Boswell et al., 2006).', 'However, little is still known about the precise relationship between health-related behavior and psychological well-being.', 'Moreover, there have been very few studies regarding the impact of spirituality on health-related behavior, although the former was recognized as one of four dimensions of health (Harris et al., 1999).', 'Present Study\\nThe main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between spirituality, health-related behavior, type of acquired education, and psychological well-being.', 'To achieve this goal, a path analysis was conducted.', 'It is considered one of a few possible statistical approaches addressing the problem of spirituality and health, recommended by Miller and Thoresen (2003).', 'The path model helps to verify assumed relationships between a set of variables represented as a structure of the tested model, which is based on theoretical associations between the variables.', 'It also provides a framework for the analysis of the direct, indirect, and total effects, whose form provides an analytical basis for interpreting moderation effects (Alwin and Hausner, 1975; Miller and Thoresen, 2003).', 'Direct effects are regression coefficients representing the structural components of the model; indirect effects are parts of causal influence transmitted by intervening moderator and mediator variables; and total effects are the totals of direct and indirect effects (Alwin and Hausner, 1975; Pearl, 2012).', 'It must be highlighted that although path analysis implies causality, it cannot be inferred from the gathered data since it is cross-sectional (Bollen and Pearl, 2013).', 'The directions of the relations in the model were based on the mentioned literature, yet the model itself was not aimed at testing causal effects.', 'The path analysis was used to disaggregate, quantify, and compare the magnitude of associations between the variables (Miller and Thoresen, 2003; Bollen and Pearl, 2013).', 'The impact of spirituality on recovery from disease and the promotion of health is a topic that has received the attention of many researchers and scholars around the world.', 'Spirituality is considered one of the natural capacities of humans that has positive effects on individuals’ health.', 'The aim of this study was to review the impact of spirituality on people’s health and to discuss the relationship between health and belief in spiritual powers.', 'Evidence Acquisition: This study comprised a non-systematic narrative review of original and reliable scientific articles on spirituality published from 1972 to 2014.', 'The research strategy was carried out using electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar.', 'Considering the goal of the research, 51 articles were selected and reviewed.', 'Results: Most studies indicated the positive impact of spirituality on people’s health.', 'Recourse to spiritual powers leads to reductions in anxiety and concern among patients and their families, and allows people to more easily accept and cope with their health disorders.', 'Conclusions: To date, most of the studies conducted on the topic have confirmed the positive impact of religious beliefs and other spiritual approaches on health and the course of recovery from acute and chronic diseases.', 'Based on these findings, medical personnel should turn their attention to the advantages of spirituality in relation to patients’ treatment and acquaint patients and their families with such spiritual benefits.', 'Spirituality places far greater emphasis on human principles than religious practices, and indicates a person’s feelings about the meaning and goals of life beyond material values .', 'Spirituality encompasses a series of meanings that underline aspiration, compatibility, vision, beliefs, and the meaningfulness of conditions .', 'It is an inextricable element of human life and an important factor that enables humans to overcome numerous challenges.', 'When considering spirituality, a different definition of health is given with respect to independent human identity.', 'Traditionally, health represents humans’ biologic identity based on modern medical science and the principle definitions of health ; however, another identity is humans’ psychological or sympathetic perceptions, which constitute community health.', 'During the 19th and first half of the 20th century, diseases were described as disorders in the body’s physiologic processes, a definition that remains dominant in medicine.', 'In the second half of the 20th century, the indirect impact of physical and mental interaction on health status was officially recognized.', 'Attention then turned to the question of why some individuals become ill frequently and have delayed recoveries.', 'Presently, people are again considering that there is a relationship between spirituality and health.', 'Religious beliefs and spirituality are deemed beneficial to the maintenance of physical and psychological health, a reality which, once more, revives the idea of the integration of the body and the psyche.', 'Notwithstanding, the trend in medical science is inclined toward the dominant perspectives of religious outlook, which are free of extravagance and prejudice .', 'All divine religions, particularly Islam, place special emphasis on the non-material aspects of life and draw attention to the spiritual life of mankind.', 'Due to this capacity, Islam, as well as other monotheistic religions, play a key role in helping people cope with disease .', 'As Imam Ali (May God’s greetings be upon him) stated 14 centuries ago, “Be aware that poverty is the greatest of all evils, and physical ill health is more severe than destitution, and worse still is illness of the heart, and remember that the greatest blessing is piety of the heart, followed by, in order of importance, bodily health and financial security.” Herein, sin and transgression are mentioned with respect to the ailing soul and heart .', 'In addition, Imam Ali urged people to avoid scourges, hardships, and difficulties through prayer, a means that emphasizes the impact of prayer and praise to God on physical and psychological health .', 'Imam Sadegh (May God’s greetings be upon him) said, “If any one of you gets caught up in one of the worldly sorrows, it isn’t difficult if he/she, after having prayer’s ablution (vozou) goes to the mosque, prays, and asks God to remove his/her sadness.', 'Have you not heard that God has said, ‘Seek help from patience and praying’”.', 'Nowadays, many studies regarding the connection between spirituality and health are in progress.', 'Naturally, the topics discussed in this context comprise a series of criteria such as mortality, the eventual benchmark of health, living efficiency, and treatment.', 'Additionally, it is thought that the different aspects of religion, as with most prominent aspects of spirituality, could have a positive impact on health .', 'Thus, religious practices and acts of worship, especially at special times and in particular places, could lead to the regulation of the body’s important physiological reactions .', 'Experimental results have largely been compatible with the perspective that, through different mechanisms, religion is an important factor in preventing many diseases and the promotion of health .', 'Gallup’s opinion poll conducted in 1998 indicated that 60% of Americans reported religion to be of the utmost importance in their lives, and over 82% believed that they needed spiritual improvement, the survey thus confirming people’s considerable concern with spirituality .', 'Such observations and results have redoubled the need to pay attention to the effect of religious beliefs on the psychological and physical health of people and their impact on trends of compliance, recovery, and the treatment of disease.', 'The present study explores the latest findings on the impact of spirituality on physical and psychological health.', 'Religious coping is the most common reaction to health problems and disorders .', 'Patients who are spiritual may use their beliefs to cope with disease, pain, and stressful situations.', 'Patients with spiritual vision have a more positive perspective on life and report a better quality of life  and well-being .', 'One of the best examples of compliance with disease is based on evidence obtained from patients with different types of cancer .', 'In such cases, patients cope more easily with their disease, are happier and more satisfied with their lives, and feel less pain  due to their spiritual beliefs and religious outlooks.', 'Other evidence has shown that spirituality plays an important role in quality of health, especially among the elderly and those afflicted with non-communicable diseases .', 'Studies have confirmed a connection between a spiritual lifestyle and people’s capacity to enjoy life, even when associated with symptoms of pain .', 'The results of the distribution of pain questionnaire obtained from hospitalized patients in the United States showed that personal prayers are the most common non-medication approach to controlling pain .', 'Prayer is therefore worth considering as a way to cope with pain.', 'Having a spiritual vision can help patients comply with disease and confront death.', 'In one study, 93% of 108 patients suffering from cancer cited their religious beliefs as a strategy for coping with cancer .', 'In another study, 26.1% of the subjects with cancer, chronic pain, and heart disease stated that religious practice helped them deal with their illnesses .', 'Notably, a relatively high proportion of these patients comprised those afflicted with cancer.', 'In terms of Alzheimer’s disease, praying is the most important spiritual training used to tackle the disease .', 'Additionally, among patients and their families prayer is a strategy for managing cancer pain .', 'Studies of parents who had lost children to cancer confirmed the positive impact of spirituality on stress reduction and compliance with their conditions after the death of their children .', 'Saying prayers also helps alleviate anxiety and concern in mothers of children suffering from cancer .', 'This effect was confirmed by meditation groups as well as written statements from patients.', 'The positive impact of yoga and spirituality on the relationship between the body and the psyche and the role played by psychology (mind) in the Indian community have been reported ; however, there were some ambiguities concerning the efficiency of the study.', 'Recovery\\nRecovery and convalescence following surgical operations are accelerated by spiritual commitments.', 'Spirituality has been referred to as a positive and complementary approach to physical activity and treatment by physicians .', 'Saying prayers as a practical manifestation of spirituality is effective in the treatment of many acute and chronic diseases .', 'For example, heart transplant patients who participated in religious activities stated that their beliefs played an important role in their improved compliance with treatment, and they also exhibited higher levels of self-confidence, less anxiety and apprehension, and an improvement in physical performance over a period of 12 months .', 'Similarly, people with spiritual vision have shown lower levels of depression, despair, and cognitive disorders, with positive recovery trends.', 'By and large, people with less apprehension are healthier, and it seems likely that spirituality enables people to enjoy better health and to live better lives with less depression .', 'Advantages of Familiarity With Patients’ Spiritual Vision\\nFamiliarity with the spiritual aspects of patients is beneficial to both patients and physicians.', 'From most patients’ perspectives, a discussion with their physician about their beliefs is very beneficial; however, in practice, few physicians have such conversations with their patients.', 'According to a study conducted at a lung hospital in Pennsylvania, 66% of patients indicated that their confidence in their physician was boosted when their physician queried their spiritual beliefs.', 'In addition, 94% of patients who adhered to spiritual principles demanded that physicians consider their religious beliefs and the framework of their values, and as many as 50% of secular individuals stated that physicians must at least talk to patients with serious conditions about their religious beliefs .', 'From physicians’ perspectives, knowledge about the spiritual vision of patients helps them understand the disease.', 'Notably, religious beliefs may impact healthcare-related decision-making, which is important for the development of treatment strategies .', 'In addition, evaluating the spiritual vision of patients alleviates their living problems.', 'Therefore, a sound understanding of patients’ spiritual beliefs is inseparable from patient care .', 'Table 1 presents excerpts from some reviewed studies on the relationship between spirituality and health categorized according to mortality, coping and compliance, and recovery.']\n"

      "Spirituality is the broad concept of a belief in something beyond the self.\n",
      "It may involve religious traditions centering on the belief in a higher power, but it can also involve a holistic belief in an individual connection to others and to the world as a whole.\n",
      "Spirituality offers a worldview that suggests there is more to life than just what people experience on a sensory and physical level.\n",
      "Instead, it suggests that there is something greater that connects all beings to each other and to the universe itself.\n",
      "It also proposes that there is ongoing existence after death and strives to answer questions about the meaning of life, how people are connected to each other, truths about the universe, and other mysteries of human existence.\n",
      "Spirituality and religious activity have been a source of comfort and relief from stress for multitudes of people.\n",
      "While people use many different religions and paths to find God or to express their spirituality, research has shown that those who are more religious or spiritual and use their spirituality to cope with challenges in life experience many benefits to their health and well-being.\n",

      "Signs of Spirituality\n",
      "Spirituality is not a single path or belief system.\n",
      "There are many ways to experience spirituality and the benefits of a spiritual experience.\n",
      "For some people, this might involve the belief in a higher power or a specific religious practice.\n",
      "For others, it may involve experiencing a sense of connection to a higher state or a sense of inter-connectedness with the rest of humanity and nature.\n",
      "Some signs of spirituality can include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tAsking deep questions about topics such as suffering and what happens after death\n",
      "\t\tDeepening connections with other people\n",
      "\t\tExperiencing compassion and empathy for others\n",
      "\t\tExperiencing feelings of interconnectedness\n",

      "\t\tSeeking meaning and purpose\n",
      "\t\tWanting to make the world a better place\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Not everyone experiences or expresses spirituality in the same way.\n",
      "Some people may seek spiritual experiences in every aspect of their lives, while others may be more likely to have these feelings under specific conditions or in certain locations.\n",
      "For example, some people may be more likely to have spiritual experiences in churches or other religious temples, while some might have these feelings when they out enjoying nature.\n",
      "Types of Spirituality\n",
      "There are many different types of spirituality, ranging from religious traditions to more secular approaches.\n",
      "Some of the major forms of spirituality include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tBuddhism\n",
      "\t\tChristianity\n",
      "\t\tHinduism\n",

      "\t\tNew age spirituality\n",
      "\t\tSikhism\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is important to remember that there are many other spiritual traditions that exist throughout the world, including traditional African and Indigenous spiritual practices.\n",
      "Such spiritual practices can be particularly important to groups of people who have been subjected to the effects of colonialism.\n",
      "Uses\n",
      "There are a number of different reasons why people may turn to spirituality, including but not limited to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tTo find purpose and meaning: Exploring spirituality can help people find answers to questions they have about philosophical questions such as \"what is the meaning of life?\"\n",
      "and \"what purpose does my life serve?\"\n",
      "To cope with feelings of stress, depression, and anxiety: Spiritual experiences can be helpful when coping with the stresses of life.\n",
      "To restore hope and optimism: Spirituality can help people develop a more hopeful outlook on life.\n",
      "To find a sense of community and support: Because spiritual traditions often involve organized religions or groups, becoming a part of such a group can serve as an important source of social support.\n",
      "Impact of Spirituality\n",
      "While specific spiritual views are a matter of faith, research has demonstrated some of the benefits of spirituality and spiritual activity.\n",
      "The results may surprise no one who has found comfort in their religious or spiritual views, but they are definitely noteworthy in that they demonstrate in a scientific way that these activities do have benefits for many people.\n",
      "The following are a few more of the many positive findings related to spirituality and its influence on physical and mental health:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tResearch has shown that religion and spirituality can help people cope with the effects of everyday stress.\n",
      "One study found that everyday spiritual experiences helped older adults better cope with negative feelings and enhanced positive feelings.\n",
      "Research shows that older women are more grateful to God than older men, and they receive greater stress-buffering health effects due to this gratitude.3﻿\n",
      "\t\tAccording to research, those with an intrinsic religious orientation, regardless of gender, exhibited less physiological reactivity toward stress than those with an extrinsic religious orientation.4﻿ Those who were intrinsically oriented dedicated their lives to God or a \"higher power,\" while the extrinsically oriented ones used religion for external ends like making friends or increasing community social standing.\n",
      "This, along with other research, demonstrates that there may be tangible and lasting benefits to maintaining involvement with a spiritual community.\n",
      "This involvement, along with the gratitude that can accompany spirituality, can be a buffer against stress and is linked to greater levels of physical health.\n",
      "Dedication to God or a \"higher power\" translated into less stress reactivity, greater feelings of well-being, and ultimately even a decreased fear of death.\n",
      "People who feel comfortable and comforted using spirituality as a coping mechanism for stress can rest assured that there's even more evidence that this is a good idea for them.\n",
      "Prayer works for young and old alike.\n",
      "Prayer and spirituality have been linked to:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tBetter health\n",
      "\t\tGreater psychological well-being\n",
      "\t\tLess depression5﻿\n",
      "\t\tLess hypertension\n",
      "\t\tLess stress, even during difficult times6﻿\n",
      "\t\tMore positive feelings\n",
      "\t\tSuperior ability to handle stress\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips\n",
      "Whether you are rediscovering a forgotten spiritual path, reinforcing your commitment to an already well-established one, or seeking a new source of spiritual fulfillment, exploring your spiritual side may help improve your well-being.\n",
      "Spirituality is a very personal experience, and everyone’s spiritual path may be unique.\n",
      "Research shows, however, that some spiritual stress relief strategies have been helpful to many, regardless of faith.7﻿﻿ Some things you can do to start exploring spirituality include:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\tPay attention to how you are feeling: Part of embracing spirituality means also embracing what it means to be human, both the good and the bad.\n",
      "Focus on others: Opening your heart, feeling empathy, and helping others are important aspects of spirituality.\n",
      "Meditate: Try spending 10 to 15 minutes each morning engaged in some form of meditation.\n",
      "Practice gratitude: Start a gratitude journal and record what you are grateful for each day.\n",
      "This can be a great reminder of what is most important to you and what brings you the greatest happiness.\n",
      "Try mindfulness: By becoming more mindful, you can become more aware and appreciative of the present.\n",
      "Mindfulness encourages you to be less judgmental (both of yourself and others) and focus more on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or future.\n",
      "Visualization meditation is a powerful way to use the mind to influence the body and can also be an empowering way to manifest desired outcomes in your life.\n",
      "Deepak Chopra teaches that what we place our attention on grows stronger and what we take our attention away from will begin to diminish.\n",
      "The unconscious mind is extremely powerful and it works very well with imagery.\n",
      "One common visualization practice is centered around health.\n",
      "By visualizing your body-mind as being healthy, vibrant, and energized—or grounded, peaceful, and calm—you can begin to elicit these things both mentally and physically.\n",
      "Another approach is using visual imagery for creative purposes.\n",
      "By constructing an image in your mind of what your life might look like after having accomplished a goal and really seeing yourself having already achieved it is a way to begin living in ways that support the manifestation of your desired outcome.\n",
      "To meditate using visual imagery, practice the following:\n",
      "\t1\tIdentify your desired outcome.\n",
      "For example, do you wish to feel more grounded and at peace in your mind and emotions?\n",
      "Or would you like to envision your physical body as being healthy, vibrant, and strong?\n",
      "Or are you longing to create art, write poetry, be in a new relationship, or travel abroad?\n",
      "2\tCreate an internal representation of what this looks, sounds, and feels like.\n",
      "Make it as real and as compelling as possible.\n",
      "3\tEnter into a meditative state by relaxing and taking some deep breaths and then bring the image into your awareness.\n",
      "Associate yourself into the picture by stepping inside it and feeling as if it has already happened.\n",
      "4\tWhen it's time to come out of meditation, simply allow the image to fade off into the distance and relinquish any attachment to the outcome.\n",
      "5\tMeditate in this fashion anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes each day.\n",
      "Japa or Mantra-Based Meditation\n",
      "Japa meditation is a mantra-based meditation path that is one of the oldest, most revered classical techniques known today.\n",
      "The word “mantra” translates to mind vehicle or mind instrument.\n",
      "Japa meditation has the practitioner repeating a word or phrase for the duration of the meditation, with the mantra being the focal point throughout.\n",
      "During the practice, whenever you drift away from the mantra to other thoughts, sounds, or physical sensations, you simply guide your focus back to the repetition of the mantra.\n",
      "Think of it as a dance back and forth between mantra and thought.\n",
      "Some mantras have a specific meaning and it’s said that by repeating the mantra, you are connecting to the energetic essence of its intention.\n",
      "Other mantras purposely have no meaning and are designed to help access deeper levels of silence.\n",
      "In this approach, eventually, the mantra and thoughts will cancel one another out.\n",
      "When this happens, your conscious awareness transcends the busyness of the mind and reaches higher states of consciousness.\n",
      "Popular styles of mantra-based meditation are Primordial Sound Meditation as taught by Deepak Chopra and the age-old practice of the So Hum meditation.\n",
      "Both of these practices are easily learned in person or online for your convenience.\n",
      "Loving-Kindness or Metta Meditation\n",
      "Metta meditation, also known as Loving-Kindness meditation, is designed to cultivate four qualities of love: friendliness (Metta), compassion (Karuna), appreciative joy (Mudita), and equanimity (Upekkha).\n",
      "The quality of Metta, or friendliness, is expressed as genuine compassion sent out with the intention of surrounding ourselves and others with loving-kindness.\n",
      "With all that is going on in the world today, Metta meditation is a worthwhile practice for each of us to spend some time in each day.\n",
      "This style of meditation also works well as an entrance point for the practice of forgiveness and can be a powerful tool for lessening the charge of negative emotions we have toward those who have wronged us.\n",
      "While there are various approaches to Metta meditation, this audio clip on Loving Kindness Meditation is a thorough and well-spoken version.\n",
      "Another variation will have you think silently to yourself, “May I be filled with loving-kindness.\n",
      "May I be well.\n",
      "May I be peaceful and at ease.\n",
      "May I be truly happy.” You would then bring someone else into your mind (someone you love and/or someone who you are feeling challenged by) and say silently, \"May you be filled with loving-kindness.\n",
      "May you be well.\n",
      "May you be peaceful and at ease.\n",
      "May you be truly happy.” You may then bring all of humanity into your awareness and send the same intention out to the collective—to all sentient beings, “May we be filled with loving-kindness.\n",
      "May we be well.\n",
      "May we be peaceful and at ease.\n",
      "May we be truly happy.”\n",
      "Once you have done this meditation a few times and you remember the process, you can begin to do the meditation on your own without listening to the audio file.\n",
      "Choose whatever language you prefer to use and practice this meditation for a period of time to see how it resonates with you.\n",
      "Breath-Awareness Meditation\n",
      "Breath-awareness meditation is a simple practice of finding a comfortable seat, closing your eyes, and placing your attention in the inhalation and exhalation of your breath.\n",
      "Breath awareness is an effective way to establish a greater mind-body connection and to reduce stress.\n",
      "This form of meditation can be your preferred meditation practice each day and it is also a highly useful way to calm you down during any moment of tension in the workplace and at home.\n",
      "Once you’ve tried a few different types of meditation, you will have a better idea of what resonates with you and what doesn't.\n",
      "The most important thing to remember is that there is no right or wrong meditation; there are many paths that all lead to the same destination, and the beauty of life is that we get to choose our own path.\n",
      "Keep it simple at the beginning and just feel out some different techniques.\n",
      "When you find a routine that you enjoy, the next step is to set aside 15 to 20 minutes each day to cultivate your meditative practice.\n",
      "From there, tend to your practice each day and you will experience a number of life-changing benefits to your health and well-being.\n",
      "On a surface level, the mental body is your thoughts.\n",
      "On a deeper level, it is the domain of your beliefs, desires, values, and goals.\n",
      "Beliefs are opinions and convictions that we hold as being true without having immediate proof.\n",
      "Values represent what we hold internally as most important in an area of life.\n",
      "Values and beliefs can come from thoughts that were formed very early in childhood.\n",
      "We all have desires to achieve or acquire something in our lives, which is why we set goals and intentions to help us get where we want to go.\n",
      "Some surface-level thoughts, which may create goals or desires, direct our mental focus from moment to moment.\n",
      "This is how our logical, linear minds learn and operate, and it is one of the aspects of ourselves that is most familiar to us.\n",
      "As energy flows down from the mental body into the emotional body, it can bump into stored baggage from the past and create some turbulence.\n",
      "Stored baggage can come from past fears, which can project into the future and cause anxiety.\n",
      "Or, it can come from experiencing a lot of anger or resentment toward someone, which can cause anger or resentment later in life when familiar conditions repeat.\n",
      "You may even develop negative beliefs about people.\n",
      "Practices for the Mental Body:\n",
      "\n",
      "\t•\tSet goals\n",
      "\t•\tGet a coach or mentor to keep you focused on your goals\n",

      "\t•\tContinue your education (e.g., read books or take classes)\n",
      "\t•\tEliminate stressors from your life\n",
      "We found four relevant publications, including two reviews on the effects of yoga on depression , a description of studies on yogic breathing  for depression, and one “summary” .\n",
      "The reviewing authors have reported that the studies reviewed showed a large variety of diagnoses ranging from “major depression or some other type of diagnosed depression” to “elevated depressive symptoms” .\n",
      "Although several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reported beneficial effects of yoga interventions for treating depressive symptoms, the quality and quantity of the data from these studies appear insufficient to conclude whether there is substantial clinical justification to consider yoga as a treatment of depression.\n",
      "Compared to passive controls, the yoga interventions seem to be effective; when compared with active controls, not surprisingly, the effects are less conclusive .\n",
      "The study results are so far not sufficient in quantity and quality to determine whether studies with a focus on the asanas are more effective as compared to studies with meditation-focussed or pranayama-focussed styles.\n",
      "Thus, there is a strong need to conduct more conclusive studies with high methodological quality and larger patient samples.\n",
      "Whether motivation of depressed patients could be a problem or not remains to be clarified.\n",
      "There has been an attempt to explore mechanisms of action and to understand the complete picture of the effects of yoga in depression looking at electrophysiological markers of attention, and neurotransmitters which were found to change with yoga [7, 31].\n",
      "The six branches are:\n",
      "\t•\tHatha yoga: This is the physical and mental branch designed to prime the body and mind.\n",
      "•\tRaja yoga: This branch involves meditation and strict adherence to a series of disciplinary steps known as the “eight limbs” of yoga.\n",
      "•\tKarma yoga: This is a path of service that aims to create a future free from negativity and selfishness.\n",
      "•\tBhakti yoga: This aims to establish the path of devotion, a positive way to channel emotions and cultivate acceptance and tolerance.\n",
      "•\tJnana yoga: This branch of yoga is about wisdom, the path of the scholar, and developing the intellect through study.\n",
      "•\tTantra yoga: This is the pathway of ritual, ceremony, or consummation of a relationship.\n",
      "Yoga maintains that chakras are center points of energy, thoughts, feelings, and the physical body.\n",
      "According to yogic teachers, chakras determine the way people experience reality through emotional reactions, desires or aversions, levels of confidence or fear, and even physical symptoms and effects.\n",
      "When energy becomes blocked in a chakra, it is said to trigger physical, mental, or emotional imbalances that manifest in symptoms, such as anxiety, lethargy, or poor digestion.\n",
      "Asanas are the many physical positions in Hatha yoga.\n",
      "People who practice yoga use asanas to free energy and stimulate an imbalanced chakra.\n",
      "Ashtanga yoga: This type of yoga uses ancient yoga teachings.\n",
      "However, it became popular during the 1970s.\n",
      "Ashtanga applies six established sequences of postures that rapidly link every movement to breath.\n",
      "Bikram yoga: Also known as “hot” yoga, Bikram occurs in artificially heated rooms at temperatures of nearly 105 degrees and 40 percent humidity.\n",
      "It consists of 26 poses and a sequence of two breathing exercises.\n",
      "Hatha yoga: This is a generic term for any type of yoga that teaches physical postures.\n",
      "“Hatha” classes usually serve as a gentle introduction to the basic yoga postures.\n",
      "Iyengar yoga: This type focuses on finding the correct alignment in each pose using a range of props, such as blocks, blankets, straps, chairs, and bolsters.\n",
      "Jivamukti yoga: Jivamukti means “liberation while living.” This type emerged in 1984 and incorporates spiritual teachings and practices that focus on the fast-paced flow between poses rather than the poses themselves.\n",
      "This focus is called vinyasa.\n",
      "Each class has a theme, which is explored through yoga scripture, chanting, meditation, asana, pranayama, and music.\n",
      "Jivamukti yoga can be physically intense.\n",
      "Kripalu yoga: This type teaches practitioners to know, accept, and learn from the body.\n",
      "A student of Kripalu learns to find their own level of practice by looking inward.\n",
      "The classes usually begin with breathing exercises and gentle stretches, followed by a series of individual poses and final relaxation.\n",
      "Kundalini yoga: Kundalini means “coiled, like a snake.” Kundalini yoga is a system of meditation that aims to release pent-up energy.\n",
      "A class typically begins with chanting and ends with singing.\n",
      "In between, it features asana, pranayama, and meditation customized to create a specific outcome.\n",
      "Power yoga: In the late 1980s, practitioners developed this active and athletic type of yoga, based on the traditional ashtanga system.\n",
      "Sivananda: This is a system based on a five-point philosophy.\n",
      "This philosophy maintains that proper breathing, relaxation, diet, exercise, and positive thinking work together to form a healthy yogic lifestyle.\n",
      "Typically uses the same 12 basic asanas, bookended by sun salutations and savasana poses.\n",
      "Viniyoga: Viniyoga can adapt to any person, regardless of physical ability.\n",
      "Viniyoga teachers require in-depth training and tend to be experts on anatomy and yoga therapy.\n",
      "Yin: This is a quiet, meditative yoga practice, also called taoist yoga.\n",
      "Yin yoga allows the release of tension in key joints, including:\n",
      "\t•\tthe ankles\n",
      "\t•\tknees\n",
      "\t•\t· hips\n",
      "\t•\tthe whole back\n",
      "\t•\tneck\n",
      "\t•\tshoulders\n",
      "Yin poses are passive, meaning that gravity shoulders most of the force and effort.\n",
      "Prenatal yoga: Prenatal yoga uses postures that practitioners have designed for people who are pregnant.\n",
      "It can support people in getting back into shape after pregnancy as well as supporting health iduring pregnancy.\n",
      "Restorative yoga: This is a relaxing method of yoga.\n",
      "A person spends a restorative yoga class in four or five simple poses, using props like blankets and bolsters to sink into deep relaxation without exerting any effort in holding the pose.\n",
      "Studies suggest a positive association of spirituality and health behaviors with well-being (especially subjective well-being), but still the precise character of such relationships between all these constructs remains unknown.\n",
      "The present study aims to explore the relations between spirituality, health-related behaviors, and psychological well-being in the context of acquired education.\n",
      "A questionnaire survey was conducted among 595 students from six different universities, whose study programs either focused on the human body or the human mind and spirit.\n",
      "Path analysis and linear regression were used to model the relationship between the examined constructs.\n",
      "The results show that both spirituality and health-related behaviors are positively related to psychological well-being, and that the relationship with spirituality is also mediated by health-related behaviors.\n",
      "Only spirituality is associated with the type of acquired education, especially in the group of students whose studies focus on the human mind and spirit.\n",
      "Moreover, spirituality in this group seems to display a stronger relationship with psychological well-being.\n",
      "These findings may contribute to the better understanding of some significant determinants of psychological well-being.\n",
      "They carry important implications for the faculty members responsible for curriculum preparation to account for teaching contents related to the conduct of a healthy lifestyle and to spiritual development.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "Almost 20 years ago, following the commencement of the positive psychology movement, the research approach in the areas of psychology, especially those concerning mental health, began to change, concentrating on a much greater interest in well-being than on mere diseases or disorders (Bhullar et al., 2014).\n",
      "Two main directions have emerged in well-being research: one based on a hedonistic approach and the other on eudaimonia.\n",
      "According to the hedonistic approach, well-being is concerned with affective pleasure in someone’s life (Watson et al., 1988).\n",
      "The term subjective well-being (SWB) is used in positive psychology in the sense of a high level of positive affect, a low level of negative affect, and a high degree of satisfaction with one’s life (Deci and Ryan, 2008).\n",
      "In contrast, in the eudaemonist approach, well-being is perceived as the degree to which people function so that they could realize their full potential (Waterman, 1993).\n",
      "In publications on positive psychology eudaimonism is often synonymous with psychological well-being (PWB; Ryan and Deci, 2001).\n",
      "Recently, the main direction in studies of determinants of well-being has focused on subjective well-being (Diener, 2000).\n",
      "Demographic determinants (Argyle, 1999), cognitive and motivational determinants (Lyubomirsky, 2001), and personality determinants (Park, et al., 2004) of subjective well-being have been identified.\n",
      "Less attention is currently paid to psychological well-being, however, some research indicated religion and spirituality to be significant PWB implications (Levin and Chatters, 1998; Lawler-Row and Elliott, 2009) and revealed associations between pro-health behaviors, spirituality, and well-being (Boswell et al., 2006).\n",
      "At present, in a holistic view of health beyond biological and psychosocial well-being, the spiritual dimension of well-being is frequently discussed.\n",
      "This new construct is defined as a sense of connection with others, sense of life, and relationship with a transcendent force.\n",
      "It has psychosocial and religious components, and it is believed to promote spiritual health (Ghaderi et al., 2018; Alborzi et al., 2019).\n",
      "The present study attempts to gain a better insight into relationships between spirituality, health-related behavior, and psychological well-being with regard to the type of acquired education.\n",
      "Theoretical Background\n",
      "Psychological Well-Being\n",
      "The answer to the question “What does it mean to feel well psychologically?” needs to be sought in literature on humanistic psychology, including developmental and health psychology (Ryff, 1989).\n",
      "Ryff created a multidimensional construct of well-being, building on such concepts as basic life tendencies of Buhler (1935), psychosocial stages of Erikson (1959), personality changes of Neugarten (1973), positive criteria of mental health of Jahoda (1958), account of individuation of Jung (1933), formulation of maturity of Allport (1961), depiction of the fully-functioning person of Rogers (1961), and notion of self-actualization of Maslow (1968).\n",
      "Psychological well-being covers a wide range of welfare including positive assessments of oneself and one’s past life (Self-Acceptance), a sense of continued growth and development as a person (Personal Growth), the belief that one’s life is purposeful and meaningful (Purpose in Life), the possession of quality relations with others (Positive Relations With Others), the capacity to manage effectively one’s life and the surrounding world (Environmental Mastery), and a sense of self-determination (Autonomy; Ryff and Keyes, 1995, p. 720).\n",
      "Ryff and Singer (1998) also developed a measure to assess the above six distinct factors of positive psychological functioning.\n",
      "Both the model and the measure came under review.\n",
      "The former was criticized for the lack of independence of individual scales (Springer and Hausner, 2006).\n",
      "According to various researchers, Personal Growth, Purpose in Life, Self-Acceptance, and Environmental Mastery do form a single scale.\n",
      "The latter was criticized for its lack of factorial validity or internal consistency (van Dierendonck, 2004).\n",
      "However, some other studies supported the six-factor PWB model (Ryff and Singer, 2006; van Dierendonck et al., 2008) and also revealed the existence of a single higher-order PWB factor above the subscales (Keyes et al., 2002).\n",
      "The concept of PWB corresponds to the WHO definition of health as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, not merely the absence of disease or infirmity, formulated in 1948 (WHO, 1948).\n",
      "A high level of PWB is associated with a lower risk of depression (Ryff and Keyes, 1995; Fava, 1999), a lower possibility of displaying risk behavior (Yonker et al., 2012), and a decreased immune cell expression of a conserved transcriptional response to adversity (CTRA; Fredrickson et al., 2015).\n",
      "Spirituality\n",
      "According to Joseph et al.\n",
      "(2017, p. 506), spirituality should be understood as “a more general, unstructured, personalized, and naturally occurring phenomenon, where a person seeks closeness and/or connectedness between him/herself and a higher power or purpose.” Other authors define spirituality in terms of search for universal truth and as an activity enabling people to discover meaning and significance in the surrounding world (Woods and Ironson, 1999).\n",
      "Spirituality can also be perceived as a dynamic reality, constantly exploring something new; it may also involve the learning of the ultimate boundaries of existence and seeking a broader meaning of life.\n",
      "Hart (1994, p. 23) defined spirituality as a way in which an individual experiences his or her faith in everyday life and style “in which the individual refers to the final conditions of individual existence.”\n",
      "Spirituality therefore forms a multidimensional theoretical construct.\n",
      "In essence, it constitutes transcendence understood as going beyond or above “the real I.” In this context, spirituality is defined as experiencing transcendence through inner peace, harmony, or connectedness to others (Boswell et al., 2006).\n",
      "Transcendence can take place both within the person (self-realization, self-improvement, and personal development) and outside the person.\n",
      "“External” transcendence may be directed to a higher entity or energy; to another person, claimed to be of particular value, whose good is more important than one’s own good; or to the universe (Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska, 2004).\n",
      "Spirituality differs from religion as the latter is rather linked with specific rituals, institutional dependencies, and social relationships, whereas the former is more about personal experience of what is unseen and recognized as greater than ourselves (Tovar-Murray, 2011).\n",
      "Thoresen (1998) claims that religion is perceived mainly as a social phenomenon, while spirituality is usually considered at the individual level and within a specific context.\n",
      "Despite their common transcendence-related roots, spirituality and religiosity may not be treated interchangeably.\n",
      "These are different areas, however, overlapping in their meaning (Krok, 2009a).\n",
      "Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska (2004) understand transcendence as a common denominator for many concepts of spirituality.\n",
      "The two-way understanding of transcendence, described above as self-improvement and as a turn toward a higher-being, makes it possible to examine the phenomenon of spirituality using the methodology of psychological sciences, without questioning theological and philosophical perspectives (Krok, 2009a).\n",
      "Studies demonstrated the positive impact of spirituality on physical health and mental health as well as on other positive health outcomes such as subjective well-being, health-related quality of life, coping skills, recovering from mental illness, or less addictive or suicidal behaviors (Mueller et al., 2001; Miller and Thoresen, 2003; Kharitonov, 2012; Unterrainer et al., 2014).\n",
      "However, we must bear in mind that spirituality is a complex construct and as such it is defined in multiple ways and measured with different tools (Lun and Bond, 2013).\n",
      "In our study, we used the Self-Reported Questionnaire by Heszen-Niejodek and Gruszyńska (2004), in which the overall factor Spirituality consists of Religious Attitudes (religious experiences, their importance in everyday life, their influence on moral choices and behavior, and relationship to God); Ethical Sensitivity (high place of ethical values in the hierarchy of values, our compliance with them, and tendency toward ethical reflection); and Harmony (seeking harmony with the world, internal consistency, and cohesion of various forms of one’s own activity).\n",
      "These dimensions reflect the main manifestations of spirituality available in internal experience, distinguished on the basis of descriptions of specific manifestations of spirituality in psychological literature (Hill et al., 2000; Socha, 2000; Thoresen and Harris, 2002), subsequently ordered according to the aforementioned directions of transcendence (me, God, other people, and the world).\n",
      "Health-Related Behavior\n",
      "Lifestyle and lifestyle-related health behaviors are some of the determinants of health potential (Binkowska-Bury et al., 2010).\n",
      "A health behavior is any activity undertaken to prevent or detect disease or to improve health and well-being (Conner and Norman, 1996).\n",
      "In studies on health behavior and behavioral change, health behaviors are usually divided into those associated with physical activity, diet, and the use of psychoactive substances (Norman et al., 2008).\n",
      "However, there are currently other more popular approaches that consider multiple lifestyle-forming health behaviors, between which different interactions take place (op.\n",
      "cit).\n",
      "The present study uses an approach that distinguishes four categories of health-related behaviors: (a) proper nutrition habits (eating proper food and keeping a well-balanced diet); (b) prophylaxis (obeying health recommendations and obtaining health and disease information); (c) positive attitude (avoiding emotional overload, stress, or depressing situations); and (d) pro-health practices (good sleeping habits, relaxation, and physical activity; Juczyński, 2009).\n",
      "The positive impact of health-related behavior on subjective well-being has already been the subject of studies on various age groups: adolescents (Shaffer-Hudkins, 2011; Sacker, 2012), university students (Binkowska-Bury et al., 2010), and older adults (Boswell et al., 2006).\n",
      "However, little is still known about the precise relationship between health-related behavior and psychological well-being.\n",
      "Moreover, there have been very few studies regarding the impact of spirituality on health-related behavior, although the former was recognized as one of four dimensions of health (Harris et al., 1999).\n",
      "Present Study\n",
      "The main aim of this study was to examine the relationship between spirituality, health-related behavior, type of acquired education, and psychological well-being.\n",
      "To achieve this goal, a path analysis was conducted.\n",
      "It is considered one of a few possible statistical approaches addressing the problem of spirituality and health, recommended by Miller and Thoresen (2003).\n",
      "The path model helps to verify assumed relationships between a set of variables represented as a structure of the tested model, which is based on theoretical associations between the variables.\n",
      "It also provides a framework for the analysis of the direct, indirect, and total effects, whose form provides an analytical basis for interpreting moderation effects (Alwin and Hausner, 1975; Miller and Thoresen, 2003).\n",
      "Direct effects are regression coefficients representing the structural components of the model; indirect effects are parts of causal influence transmitted by intervening moderator and mediator variables; and total effects are the totals of direct and indirect effects (Alwin and Hausner, 1975; Pearl, 2012).\n",
      "It must be highlighted that although path analysis implies causality, it cannot be inferred from the gathered data since it is cross-sectional (Bollen and Pearl, 2013).\n",
      "The directions of the relations in the model were based on the mentioned literature, yet the model itself was not aimed at testing causal effects.\n",
      "The path analysis was used to disaggregate, quantify, and compare the magnitude of associations between the variables (Miller and Thoresen, 2003; Bollen and Pearl, 2013).\n",
      "The impact of spirituality on recovery from disease and the promotion of health is a topic that has received the attention of many researchers and scholars around the world.\n",
      "Spirituality is considered one of the natural capacities of humans that has positive effects on individuals’ health.\n",
      "The aim of this study was to review the impact of spirituality on people’s health and to discuss the relationship between health and belief in spiritual powers.\n",
      "Evidence Acquisition: This study comprised a non-systematic narrative review of original and reliable scientific articles on spirituality published from 1972 to 2014.\n",
      "The research strategy was carried out using electronic databases such as Scopus, PubMed, and Google Scholar.\n",
      "Considering the goal of the research, 51 articles were selected and reviewed.\n",
      "Results: Most studies indicated the positive impact of spirituality on people’s health.\n",
      "Recourse to spiritual powers leads to reductions in anxiety and concern among patients and their families, and allows people to more easily accept and cope with their health disorders.\n",
      "Conclusions: To date, most of the studies conducted on the topic have confirmed the positive impact of religious beliefs and other spiritual approaches on health and the course of recovery from acute and chronic diseases.\n",
      "Based on these findings, medical personnel should turn their attention to the advantages of spirituality in relation to patients’ treatment and acquaint patients and their families with such spiritual benefits.\n",
      "Spirituality places far greater emphasis on human principles than religious practices, and indicates a person’s feelings about the meaning and goals of life beyond material values .\n",
      "Spirituality encompasses a series of meanings that underline aspiration, compatibility, vision, beliefs, and the meaningfulness of conditions .\n",
      "It is an inextricable element of human life and an important factor that enables humans to overcome numerous challenges.\n",
      "When considering spirituality, a different definition of health is given with respect to independent human identity.\n",
      "Traditionally, health represents humans’ biologic identity based on modern medical science and the principle definitions of health ; however, another identity is humans’ psychological or sympathetic perceptions, which constitute community health.\n",
      "During the 19th and first half of the 20th century, diseases were described as disorders in the body’s physiologic processes, a definition that remains dominant in medicine.\n",
      "In the second half of the 20th century, the indirect impact of physical and mental interaction on health status was officially recognized.\n",
      "Attention then turned to the question of why some individuals become ill frequently and have delayed recoveries.\n",
      "Presently, people are again considering that there is a relationship between spirituality and health.\n",
      "Religious beliefs and spirituality are deemed beneficial to the maintenance of physical and psychological health, a reality which, once more, revives the idea of the integration of the body and the psyche.\n",
      "Notwithstanding, the trend in medical science is inclined toward the dominant perspectives of religious outlook, which are free of extravagance and prejudice .\n",
      "All divine religions, particularly Islam, place special emphasis on the non-material aspects of life and draw attention to the spiritual life of mankind.\n",
      "Due to this capacity, Islam, as well as other monotheistic religions, play a key role in helping people cope with disease .\n",
      "As Imam Ali (May God’s greetings be upon him) stated 14 centuries ago, “Be aware that poverty is the greatest of all evils, and physical ill health is more severe than destitution, and worse still is illness of the heart, and remember that the greatest blessing is piety of the heart, followed by, in order of importance, bodily health and financial security.” Herein, sin and transgression are mentioned with respect to the ailing soul and heart .\n",
      "In addition, Imam Ali urged people to avoid scourges, hardships, and difficulties through prayer, a means that emphasizes the impact of prayer and praise to God on physical and psychological health .\n",
      "Imam Sadegh (May God’s greetings be upon him) said, “If any one of you gets caught up in one of the worldly sorrows, it isn’t difficult if he/she, after having prayer’s ablution (vozou) goes to the mosque, prays, and asks God to remove his/her sadness.\n",
      "Have you not heard that God has said, ‘Seek help from patience and praying’”.\n",
      "Nowadays, many studies regarding the connection between spirituality and health are in progress.\n",
      "Naturally, the topics discussed in this context comprise a series of criteria such as mortality, the eventual benchmark of health, living efficiency, and treatment.\n",
      "Additionally, it is thought that the different aspects of religion, as with most prominent aspects of spirituality, could have a positive impact on health .\n",
      "Thus, religious practices and acts of worship, especially at special times and in particular places, could lead to the regulation of the body’s important physiological reactions .\n",
      "Experimental results have largely been compatible with the perspective that, through different mechanisms, religion is an important factor in preventing many diseases and the promotion of health .\n",
      "Gallup’s opinion poll conducted in 1998 indicated that 60% of Americans reported religion to be of the utmost importance in their lives, and over 82% believed that they needed spiritual improvement, the survey thus confirming people’s considerable concern with spirituality .\n",
      "Such observations and results have redoubled the need to pay attention to the effect of religious beliefs on the psychological and physical health of people and their impact on trends of compliance, recovery, and the treatment of disease.\n",
      "The present study explores the latest findings on the impact of spirituality on physical and psychological health.\n",
      "Religious coping is the most common reaction to health problems and disorders .\n",
      "Patients who are spiritual may use their beliefs to cope with disease, pain, and stressful situations.\n",
      "Patients with spiritual vision have a more positive perspective on life and report a better quality of life  and well-being .\n",
      "One of the best examples of compliance with disease is based on evidence obtained from patients with different types of cancer .\n",
      "In such cases, patients cope more easily with their disease, are happier and more satisfied with their lives, and feel less pain  due to their spiritual beliefs and religious outlooks.\n",
      "Other evidence has shown that spirituality plays an important role in quality of health, especially among the elderly and those afflicted with non-communicable diseases .\n",
      "Studies have confirmed a connection between a spiritual lifestyle and people’s capacity to enjoy life, even when associated with symptoms of pain .\n",
      "The results of the distribution of pain questionnaire obtained from hospitalized patients in the United States showed that personal prayers are the most common non-medication approach to controlling pain .\n",
      "Prayer is therefore worth considering as a way to cope with pain.\n",
      "Having a spiritual vision can help patients comply with disease and confront death.\n",
      "In one study, 93% of 108 patients suffering from cancer cited their religious beliefs as a strategy for coping with cancer .\n",
      "In another study, 26.1% of the subjects with cancer, chronic pain, and heart disease stated that religious practice helped them deal with their illnesses .\n",
      "Notably, a relatively high proportion of these patients comprised those afflicted with cancer.\n",
      "In terms of Alzheimer’s disease, praying is the most important spiritual training used to tackle the disease .\n",
      "Additionally, among patients and their families prayer is a strategy for managing cancer pain .\n",
      "Studies of parents who had lost children to cancer confirmed the positive impact of spirituality on stress reduction and compliance with their conditions after the death of their children .\n",
      "Saying prayers also helps alleviate anxiety and concern in mothers of children suffering from cancer .\n",
      "This effect was confirmed by meditation groups as well as written statements from patients.\n",
      "The positive impact of yoga and spirituality on the relationship between the body and the psyche and the role played by psychology (mind) in the Indian community have been reported ; however, there were some ambiguities concerning the efficiency of the study.\n",
      "Recovery\n",
      "Recovery and convalescence following surgical operations are accelerated by spiritual commitments.\n",
      "Spirituality has been referred to as a positive and complementary approach to physical activity and treatment by physicians .\n",
      "Saying prayers as a practical manifestation of spirituality is effective in the treatment of many acute and chronic diseases .\n",
      "For example, heart transplant patients who participated in religious activities stated that their beliefs played an important role in their improved compliance with treatment, and they also exhibited higher levels of self-confidence, less anxiety and apprehension, and an improvement in physical performance over a period of 12 months .\n",
      "Similarly, people with spiritual vision have shown lower levels of depression, despair, and cognitive disorders, with positive recovery trends.\n",
      "By and large, people with less apprehension are healthier, and it seems likely that spirituality enables people to enjoy better health and to live better lives with less depression .\n",
      "Advantages of Familiarity With Patients’ Spiritual Vision\n",
      "Familiarity with the spiritual aspects of patients is beneficial to both patients and physicians.\n",
      "From most patients’ perspectives, a discussion with their physician about their beliefs is very beneficial; however, in practice, few physicians have such conversations with their patients.\n",
      "According to a study conducted at a lung hospital in Pennsylvania, 66% of patients indicated that their confidence in their physician was boosted when their physician queried their spiritual beliefs.\n",
      "In addition, 94% of patients who adhered to spiritual principles demanded that physicians consider their religious beliefs and the framework of their values, and as many as 50% of secular individuals stated that physicians must at least talk to patients with serious conditions about their religious beliefs .\n",
      "From physicians’ perspectives, knowledge about the spiritual vision of patients helps them understand the disease.\n",
      "Notably, religious beliefs may impact healthcare-related decision-making, which is important for the development of treatment strategies .\n",
      "In addition, evaluating the spiritual vision of patients alleviates their living problems.\n",
      "Therefore, a sound understanding of patients’ spiritual beliefs is inseparable from patient care .\n",
      "Table 1 presents excerpts from some reviewed studies on the relationship between spirituality and health categorized according to mortality, coping and compliance, and recovery.\n"
